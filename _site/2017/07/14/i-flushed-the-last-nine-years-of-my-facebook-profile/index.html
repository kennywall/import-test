Instead of deleting my account, I just cleaned up everything except what I have posted in 2017. In the future I will make it a yearly ritual to flush the previous year of my Facebook profileâ€“something including an altar, candles, and Mark Zuckerberg picture. After watching the last nine years flash by before my eyes, slowly over the last 4 daysâ€“I feel confident that Iâ€™m not going to need ANY of this social media diarrhea.</p><p>This work is part of a larger effort to go through all layers of my digital self and clean house. <a href="http://kinlane.com/2017/07/06/i-deleted-all-but-the-last-six-months-of-my-gmail/">I recently delete all but the last year of my Gmail</a>, and <a href="http://kinlane.com/2017/07/10/i-deleted-my-mysql-database/">deleted my central MySQL database</a>, which has been up for the last decade in some instance. Of course, I have downloaded my Facebook archive, and created backups of my Gmail and MySQL databasesâ€“which I zip up and store locally on SD cards. Along the way I managed to also cleaned up my Amazon S3 storage which has been up since 2006, and stored what I wanted to keep from their on the same SD cards.</p><p>Why am I doing this? I am just just asserting control over my digital self. Gmail and Facebook provide an unprecedented look into our livesâ€“my life. Iâ€™m thankful (sometimes) for the tools they provide, but Iâ€™m not convinced that they need to possess this intimiate look into my life for an entire decade. Iâ€™m not naive enough to think they donâ€™t have some sort of backup, cache, or at least some sort of algorithm trained on my data. But asserting control, and cleaning it up makes me feel like I am a little more in control of my digital self in a time where I feel like Iâ€™m increasingly losing control of who I am it this surveillance economy.</p><p>I did not manually clean up my Facebook profile manually. I could have automated it using the Facebook API, but I wanted to use a tool that would be available for my readers to use. Iâ€™m following the lead of my partner in crime Audrey Watters, who is <a href="http://fragments.audreywatters.com/2017/deleting-the-network">using F___book Post Manager to delete her network</a>. I took many hours to delete some years, but I just tackled it year by year going back from 2016 until 2007, until it had done its job. I had to rerun it couple times to get some more stragglers, and there are still a handful of things that wonâ€™t go away no matter whatâ€“not sure what is going on here. However, the majority of my Facebook profile has now been removed, except for anything in 2017.</p><p>When you clean up your digital profile this scale, you always think twice about itâ€“what if I need something in here at some point? However, once you are done, this feeling fades away, and you realize you will almost never need any of it, and the one or two items you do, will end up being just fine. Somewhere along the way we were convinced that all of this matters. Iâ€™m not saying it doesnâ€™t matter at all, it just doesnâ€™t matter as much as weâ€™ve convinced ourselves that it does, and we do not need a record of everything that has gone on in the past at this scale. We donâ€™t.</p><p>Having the last decade of my Facebook doesnâ€™t benefit me. It benefits Facebook. It benefits Facebook partners and advertisers. They want us to think it benefits us, but rarely will it actually serve us better ads, or surface that amazing news article or video. However, the chances that someone will be targeting you, surveilling you, or use a piece of your Facebook out of context to negatively impact your life is pretty great. In this modern digital world weâ€™ve created for ourselves, the more companies and governments have on our behavior, the bigger target we will becomeâ€“for advertising, surveilling, and p0wning.</p><p>I didnâ€™t want to delete my Facebook profile. I like keeping my network, because I enjoy sharing news I curate, and publishing the stories I write here. I also like staying in tune with my friends or families lives on Facebook. However, all of this has an expiration date, which Iâ€™ve identified as 1 year. The last year of my life is all I need on there. Once it rolls over a year, I archive it, and move on. Facebook has already aggregated the data, and trained their ML models. Keeping all this data does me no good, and just allows application integrations, advertisers, and other digital actors to look into my life, as well as my past. MY past.</p><p>Iâ€™m going to move on to Twitter next, cleaning it up just like I have done with my Facebook. Iâ€™ll continue to work through all of my personal accounts in this way. I wonâ€™t be doing this to any of my business accounts, or my personal blogs, because I see more value in keeping a history of my business activity out there, and happy to maintain a more personal view of my world that gets published within my own domain. <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2017/01/09/the-api-driven-marketplace-that-is-my-digital-self/">As I learn more about my digital self, and develop a deeper awareness of the digital bits of mine that are floating around out there</a>â€“the more I want to take control, curate, clean, and assert control over these bits. They are mine. It is me.</p></div><ul class="post__social"><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/2017/07/14/i-flushed-the-last-nine-years-of-my-facebook-profile/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?&text=I Flushed The Last 9 Years Of My Facebook Profile+http://localhost:4000/2017/07/14/i-flushed-the-last-nine-years-of-my-facebook-profile/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://localhost:4000/2017/07/14/i-flushed-the-last-nine-years-of-my-facebook-profile/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-google-plus"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&source=I Flushed The Last 9 Years Of My Facebook Profile&summary=&url=http://localhost:4000/2017/07/14/i-flushed-the-last-nine-years-of-my-facebook-profile/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.stumbleupon.com/badge/?url=http://localhost:4000/2017/07/14/i-flushed-the-last-nine-years-of-my-facebook-profile/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=http://localhost:4000/2017/07/14/i-flushed-the-last-nine-years-of-my-facebook-profile/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-reddit-alien"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=http://localhost:4000/2017/07/14/i-flushed-the-last-nine-years-of-my-facebook-profile/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-tumblr"></i></a></li><li><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/create/link/?description=&media=http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/api_evangelist_site/blog/kinlane_physical_digital_self_publish.jpg&url=http://localhost:4000/2017/07/14/i-flushed-the-last-nine-years-of-my-facebook-profile/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></article></div><section class="related section-padding"><div class="grid-xlarge"><h2 class="related__title">Related</h2><div class="related__container"><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2018/11/16/how-the-human-gets-lost-in-the-api-shuffle/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/64_118_800_500_0_max_0_1_-5.jpg" alt="How The Human Gets Lost In The API Shuffle"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">How The Human Gets Lost In The API Shuffle</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/07/voice-enablement-at-the-router-level-will-continue-to-push-surveilance-into-our-lives/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kinlane-productions/netgear/home-network-surveillance.png" alt="Voice Enablement At The Router Level Will Continue To Push Surveillance Into Our Lives"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">Voice Enablement At The Router Level Will Continue To Push Surveillance Into Our Lives</h2></div></a></article><article class="related__post"> <a class="related__link" href="http://localhost:4000/2018/09/07/this-administrations-has-revealed-to-just-how-dependent-we-are-on-storytelling/"><figure class="related__img"> <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/algorotoscope/builder/filtered/76_41_800_500_0_max_0_-5_-1.jpg" alt="This Administration Has Revealed To Me Just How Dependent We Are On Storytelling"/></figure><div><h2 class="related__text">This Administration Has Revealed To Me Just How Dependent We Are On Storytelling</h2></div></a></article></div></div></section></main><footer class="footer section-padding"><div class="grid"><div class="subscribe" id="subscribe"><div class="subscribe__container"> <span class="subscribe__title">Subscribe</span><p class="subscribe__text">Get a weekly email of posts Iâ€™ve added to the site.</p><form method="POST" action="https://samesies.us17.list-manage.com/subscribe/post-json?u=66ddf555dab480e6a8606430b&amp;id=89b3ee034f&amp;c=?" id="mc-signup" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" novalidate><div style="position: absolute;

<p>My name is <a title="Kin Lane" href="http://www.kinlane.com">Kin Lane</a> and I am a technology professional with an obsession for Application Programming Interfaces, also affectionately called APIs.</p>
<p>I've been working in the technology space for over 25 years. I remember building my own relational databases, and generating stacks of floppy disks to distribute software to clients. After spending much of my career online, I strongly believe in the openness and distributed nature of the Internet, and that the World Wide Web will be the vehicle that drives the world into the future (for better or worse).</p>
<p>I have lived as a programmer, database administrator, architect, product developer, manager and executive, and have experience in business development, sales and marketing--all while living with chronic entrepreneurialism (electro shock therapy has cured this). In this decade I've rolled all that experience into a new persona, one that focuses exclusively on APIs--called the API Evangelist.</p>
<p>I spend my days studying the technology, business and politics of APIs, and telling stories of what I see across the space. I thrive on monitoring the API industry in real-time, but also feel looking back at the history, while also keeping an eye on the future by tracking on new trends that I see emerging.</p>
<p>I'm a full time evangelist, not for a single API, but for APIs in general. My focus is not just on developers, but helping the rest of the world understand the value and potential of APIs. It is important that EVERYONE understands that APIs exist, even if they don't ever grasp the full details of the API economy.</p>
<p>I spend my days researching the world of APIs, publishing what I can to an <a href="http://apievangelist.com" target="_blank">array of 70+ Github repositories</a>, each with their own website doorway using Github pages. My platform isn't like many other industry blogs you will find. My network of sites represent my ongoing research in the space, which I publish via Github repositories. This is my live workbench, and what you read publish to the blogs across my sites are my notes--if you find a mistake, it is often because the research is unfinished, or I'm moving so fast it was missed in the editorial process. Feel free to fork, and fix, change, or contribute in any way.</p>
<p>You can always find links to my network on the home page of <a href="http://apievangelist.com">API Evangelist</a>.</p>

<p>I publish the majority of my work via my three top blogs:.</p>
<ul class="mainlist">

<p>You are welcome to email me at <a href="">info@kinlane.com</a>, however email isn't always the quickest way to reach me, as it is the first that I ignore when I'm working on projects. My social channels are usually some of the fastest ways to get my attention, or even better...doing something interesting and writing it on your blog, and then sending via one of my social channels--as I prioritize my story feeds above all.</p>

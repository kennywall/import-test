    The potential of decentralized technologies on the Internet is far greater than their counterparts.One such technology is XMPP, Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol or XMPP, is an open
    technology for real-time communication, which you find in instant messaging, multi-party chat, voice and video calls, collaboration, and content syndication applications.I am diving into the
    protocol while building commercial print applications that utilize the Google Cloud Print protocol.Using the Google Cloud Print Services API I can register commercial print applications as cloud
    printers on the Google Clound Print network.Once I register a commercial cloud print on the network, then authenticate with a user using Google authentication and authorization APIs the printer
    is ready for printing.

    I was just playing with Cinch which is a new voice to RSS service.It allows you to call a number and it records a podcast for you.It is more focused, but similar to the voice translation service
    Jott that I have been using.It gives you an RSS feed of the calls you make which you can easily blend into a Feedburner tracking RSS feed.There is no limit to the recording unlike Jott, but of
    course it doesnt translate your calls.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been spending a great deal of time learning about learning objects from a site called Merlot.Wikepedia defines a learning object as:Any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or trainingAny digital resource that can be reused to support learningWeb-based interactive chunks of e-learning designed to explain a stand-alone learning objectiveA digitized entity which can be used, reused or referenced during technology supported learningA digital, self-contained, reusable entity with a clear learning aim that contains at least three internal changing and editable components: content, instructional activities (learning activities), and context elements.As a complement, the learning object should have an external component of information which helps its identification, storage, and recovery: the metadata.I would like to see any web 2.0 application have a learning object defined for it just like we reference an RSS feed or other media link for a site today.</p>

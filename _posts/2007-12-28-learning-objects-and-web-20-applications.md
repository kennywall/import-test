{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been spending a great deal of time learning about "learning objects" from a site called Merlot.   Wikepedia defines a learning object as:"Any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or training""Any digital resource that can be reused to support learning""Web-based interactive chunks of e-learning designed to explain a stand-alone learning objective""A digitized entity which can be used, reused or referenced during technology supported learning""A digital, self-contained, reusable entity with a clear learning aim that contains at least three internal changing and editable components: content, instructional activities (learning activities), and context elements. As a complement, the learning object should have an external component of information which helps its identification, storage, and recovery: the metadata."I would like to see any web 2.0 application have a learning object defined for it just like we reference an RSS feed or other media link for a site today. If it is a web application that is fairly complex or even simple it should have at least a basic set of learning objects for it that the average user can use to learn more about the application or a teacher can use to integrate into their classroom curriculum.This is something I would like to work more on as part of the Social Media Squad and meeting its mission of Translating 2.0 to the Real World.</p>

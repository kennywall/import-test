IDrive just finished a set of Ruby samples complete with full library you can use when developing your encrypted, versioned cloud storage for your web application, using IDrive EVS REST API.
With the introduction of the web application framework Rails, the popularity of Ruby for building web apps has skyrocketed.  To support Ruby developers, IDrive has added samples to each of the 19 REST API Methods:





Get Server Address
Validate Account
Configure Account
Validate Private Key
Upload
Download
Search
Version History
Properties
Status




Create Folder
Rename
Copy and Paste
Trash
Delete
Listing
Events
Display Quota
Folder Details





You can also visit the download center, where you will find links to Github repositories containing entire Ruby libraries for integrating your web application with all the functionality available via the IDrive EVS REST API.
Using IDrive EVS, Ruby developers can deliver encrypted storage and backup within their web applications, providing security and privacy not available with Amazon S3 and other cloud providers.

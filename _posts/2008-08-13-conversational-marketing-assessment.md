    As part of every social media marketing strategy that we build we conduct a conversational marketing assessment that evaluates the target arena we are considering entering as part of the social
    media marketing campaign.We are noticing that pretty much every one of our clients has a very fragmented presence on the Internet and in the social media space.This is not their fault it is the
    nature of technology and the Internet moving forward as a company grasps their goals in this space.Having a web site has become the norm, however what do you do with Facebook, Youtube, blogs, and
    other areas.We are seeing that providing a conversational marketing assessment along with some sort of ecosystem visual showing where they exist is an excellent place to start.

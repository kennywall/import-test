{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just reading on the Programmable Web blog that they were acquired by Alcatel-Lucent.Not sure what this means for their content and direction.I have always followed programmable web because they are the best place to discover new APIs.Hopefully they can stay objective and stay focused on the next generation of API development.</p>

I wish Google would go ahead and make their move with Jotspot. I have a Jotspot account, but I forget about it when using all my other Google Applications.<br />
<br />
Hopefully soon they get Jotspot integrated withe the rest of the Google Universe.<br />
<br />
A Wiki environment will really tie everything together.

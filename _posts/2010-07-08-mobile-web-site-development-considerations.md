{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im refining my strategy for best practices in designing mobile web sites.I just added a few RSS feeds from quality design firms, and added a Google Alert.Ive put together a few things to consider when designing your web site for mobile browsers:

	Keep it Simple
	Use White Space
	Make Wise Use of Images
	Employ Mobile Specific Sub-Domains
	Only Include High Value Content
	Support Many Popular Screen Sizes
	Rapid Change of Mobile Industry
	Important Features / Essential
	Know and Target Your market

Developing a web site or web application that runs well in mobile browsers doesnt have to be a huge undertaking, but you should put together a plan and consider these simple points.More to come as I keep blending together my learning of HTML5 and development of mobile websites.</p>

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I read every day about the need for cloud computing interroperability between providers.Just about all of it is talk.Providers claim they pay attention to this point, however the only major move beyond just straight APIs is the Google Secure Data Connector release the other day.I really think interroperability between providers is going to have to be defined, and built by the masses.The developers who rely upon the cloud for their infrastructure will have to build the layers of interroperability between these provders to meet their needs.</p>

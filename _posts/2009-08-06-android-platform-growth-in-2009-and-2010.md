{% include JB/setup %}<p>Just read another post with data backing up the growth as Google Android as an application development platform.A post from ReadWriteWeb called More Developers Start Working on Android Apps has some good data from Flurry on application platform growth for Iphone, Blackberry, and Android.The post states:
Flurrys stats for Android are definitely encouraging, and there can be little doubt that more and more developers are starting to look at Android as an alternative platform - especially since Apples App Store approval process continues to be a mess.Which backs up what I have been saying about the growth of Google Android as a viable mobile platform in 2009 and 2010.Definitely something to watch if you are considering developing an application for Iphone, Android or Blackberry.</p>

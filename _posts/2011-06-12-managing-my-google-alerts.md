<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/google-alerts.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I am making some adjustments to my [Google Alerts][1] today.

I removed a few and added a few alerts.

Here are my current Google Alerts:

  * call for papers
  * kin lane
  * open API
  * REST API
  * self publishing
  * self-publishing
  * API Evangelist
  * apple airprint
  * Application Programming Interface
  * Google Cloud Print
  * hackathon
  * HP ePrint
  * Print on Demand
  * Web Services
I have all of them delivered once a day, via RSS feeds. This way I can monitor in real-time using Google Reader.

I adjust these every week if I can, but sometimes it remains pretty constant. It depends on topic.

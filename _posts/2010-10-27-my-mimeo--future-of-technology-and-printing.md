{% include JB/setup %}I am in New York City this week kicking off my new career as the API Evangelist for Mimeo Connect.
Mimeo  Connect is the API for the Mimeo Print Platform. Before evangelizing  about the API I have to talk about the Mimeo Platform for a bit. I have  spent the week learning everything I can about the self-service, next  generation print platform.

What  intrigued me about this job is the unique blend of technology and  manufacturing that is involved. The Mimeo team truly does it, they  have created a beautiful print document builder, storage and ordering  system seamlessly integrated with 3 print facilities in New Jersey,  Tennessee, and California.
Once  signed up for a Mimeo account you can build bound documents, binders,  booklets, flyers, brochures, posters and much more. I'm impressed with  the UI and the level of control you have over building and viewing your  document.
You  also get a lot of control over the ordering, turn-around, and shipping  involved with your print orders. Get this, you can get online at night  and build your documents, and if you have ordered by 10:00 PM EST, it  will be delivered by 8:30 AM. All without going to Kinkos in the middle  of the night in some weird part of town.
I'm  really honored to be evangelizing such an amazing product. I can't  rave enough about the company, its philosophy, and approach to  transforming the future of technology and printing as we know it.?

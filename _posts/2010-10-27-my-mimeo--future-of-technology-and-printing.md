I am in New York City this week kicking off my new career as the API Evangelist for [Mimeo Connect][1].

[Mimeo Connect][1] is the API for the [Mimeo Print Platform][2]. Before evangelizing about the API I have to talk about the Mimeo Platform for a bit. I have spent the week learning everything I can about the self-service, next generation print platform. [<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo-logo.jpg" alt="" width="300" align="right" />][2] What intrigued me about this job is the unique blend of technology and manufacturing that is involved. The Mimeo team truly does it, they have created a beautiful print document builder, storage and ordering system seamlessly integrated with 3 print facilities in New Jersey, Tennessee, and California.

Once signed up for a Mimeo account you can build bound documents, binders, booklets, flyers, brochures, posters and much more. I'm impressed with the UI and the level of control you have over building and viewing your document.

You also get a lot of control over the ordering, turn-around, and shipping involved with your print orders. Get this, you can get online at night and build your documents, and if you have ordered by 10:00 PM EST, it will be delivered by 8:30 AM. All without going to Kinkos in the middle of the night in some weird part of town.

I'm really honored to be evangelizing such an amazing product. I can't rave enough about the company, its philosophy, and approach to transforming the future of technology and printing as we know it.?

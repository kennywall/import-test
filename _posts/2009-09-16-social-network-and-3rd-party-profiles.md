    I was just seeing which of my <a class="zem_slink" title="Social network" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network">social network</a> profiles show up in my top 10
    google search results. I was also maintaining the <a class="zem_slink" title="Facebook" rel="homepage" href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> Page I setup for WebEvents Global. I like the page
    activity Facebook pages gives you. It also gives your more reporting if you take out ads, regarding their performance. It would be nice if all social networks give you a base set of analytics to
    show you profile view counts, your profile activity and other tools.

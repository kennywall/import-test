{% include JB/setup %}I was just seeing which of my social network profiles show up in my top 10 google search results. I was also maintaining the Facebook Page I setup for WebEvents Global.
I like the page activity Facebook pages gives you. It also gives your more reporting if you take out ads, regarding their performance.
It would be nice if all social networks give you a base set of analytics to show you profile view counts, your profile activity and other tools.

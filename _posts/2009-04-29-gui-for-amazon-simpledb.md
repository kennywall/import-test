{% include JB/setup %}<p>I really love the Amazon SimpleDB tool. The concept is great. Many of the web applications I build use only very basic database functionality.
I have come across many companies that use SQL Server and pay the license but they only use 10% of the functionality. They use it for Simple Storage.
So I have really advocated for the movement to Amazon SimpleDB as a database back end whenever possible. I haven't been very successful, even with my own pet projects.
So I stumbled acrossed a post about someone who built a Query Tool for Amazon SimpleDB.
I think this will really help move forward Amazon SimpleDB adoption. Quite a few developers I know need a GUI tool to help them write queries.

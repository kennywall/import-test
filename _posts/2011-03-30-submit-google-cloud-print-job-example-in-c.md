{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been working on my Google Cloud Print Proxy software in PHP to make available for a wider audience.When I get more time I intend to work on Ruby and Python versions.Much of the work being done with the Google Cloud Print Services Interface is being done by major printer manufacturers in private.I see some of this, through the conversation on the developers wiki, but they tend to not share very much
One developer shared his new C# example for submitting a Google Cloud Print Job last night.I wanted to share with everyone.</p>

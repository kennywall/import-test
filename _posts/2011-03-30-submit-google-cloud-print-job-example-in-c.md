{% include JB/setup %}I have been working on my Google Cloud Print Proxy software in PHP to make available for a wider audience.
When I get more time I intend to work on Ruby and Python versions.
Much of the work being done with the Google Cloud Print Services Interface is being done by major printer manufacturers in private.
I see some of this, through the conversation on the developers wiki, but they tend to not share very much
One developer shared his new C# example for submitting a Google Cloud Print Job last night.  I wanted to share with everyone.

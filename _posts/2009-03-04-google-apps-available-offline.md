     So Google has release offline access for Google Calendar to all users. Now I have offline access enabled for my key Google Apps.

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Google Mail (Gmail)
     </li>

     <li>Google Docs
     </li>

     <li>Google Calendars
     </li>

     <li>Google Reader
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     This allows me to use all these applications while I am not connected to the Internet on the road or otherwise. It is pretty exciting because it makes my Google Office Suite much more like Microsoft Office. I think it is a huge step forward for running your office suite in the clouds!

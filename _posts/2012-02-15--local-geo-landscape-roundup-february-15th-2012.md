A few weeks ago, more than 60 new timeline apps went live. These apps - many in the lifestyle category - broadened what was available to people on Facebook beyond the music, news and video apps that were introduced at f8 in September. Music apps like Spotify, Songza and Deezer are seeing dramatic increases in sharing and music discovery.

Since then, momentum has been building, and today, more than 60 million visitors interact with apps and games on the platform every month. In October we also invited mobile developers to join us for a Mobile Hack in Palo Alto. We later visited mobile developers in New York and Boston to hold similar events. Hundreds joined us at each event, learned about the Facebook Mobile Platform, worked on mobile hack projects, and presented them to panels of VCs and tech executives. We were thrilled that these mobile hack events attracted developers from around the world, from as far afield as London, Israel and Brazil.

The discussion centers arounddisambiguation. Now you might be wondering… what is disambiguation? Simply put, disambiguation is the process of resolving conflicts to remove ambiguity. We’ve discussed this topic a number of times in this blog and Flip will be presenting on how this concept affects the way we ask questions and find answers about Big Data. For more details on the talk, check out the Strata schedule.

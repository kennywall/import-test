     I'm reading all the posts, tweets and streams about Google losing the emails of a whole bunch of Gmail accounts. I see the the cloud computing naysayers stepping up with, "SEE, don't get too dependent on the cloud!" It reminds me of a company I worked at once, where after 48 hours of Microsoft Exchange server being down, IT held a meeting and said everyone's email accounts were removed and there were no backups. Everyone gets to start fresh with their email account!! The Gmail loss of emails reminds me....get dependent on whoever you want. Gmail, Microsoft or your companies IT. Just make sure you have a good quality backup process for ANY service you depend on.

     I got 3 birthday wishes today from sites that I have signed up for. Birthdays do not mean much to me, I really do not hold it against anyone for forgetting my Birthday.

     <br />
     I really do not look to celebrate my Birthday. However it does stick in my mind when someone wishes me a Happy Birthday. It is just one of those subtle little items that I remember.

     3 different software services I have signed up for using the data I signed up with sent out a Happy Birthday to me.

     What a great way to reach a users heart and develop a loyal relationship.

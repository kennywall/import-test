     I am getting to know the Google Gtalk API a little more and playing around with automating GTalk communication using bots and other web-based tools. I came across a nice XMPPHP class that works great....saves me a lot of work. Check it out: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/xmpphp/">http://code.google.com/p/xmpphp/</a>

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I started following the Dalia Lhama on Twitter today. He already has 11K followers and they seem overwhelmed by the response somewhat. You can follow the Dalai Lhama at http://twitter.com/ohhdl
I had a funny thought as I was following. Not saying the Dalai Lhama has any relation or similiarities to God, but in my limited religious experience when I was a kid I envisioned praying very much like Twitter. With god following all of us and we follow him.
I just think that twitter client isn't as standardized as twitter. :)</p>

I started following the Dalia Lhama on Twitter today. He already has 11K followers and they seem overwhelmed by the response somewhat. You can follow the Dalai Lhama at 

I had a funny thought as I was following. Not saying the Dalai Lhama has any relation or similiarities to God, but in my limited religious experience when I was a kid I envisioned praying very much like Twitter. With god following all of us and we follow him.

I just think that twitter client isn't as standardized as twitter. :)

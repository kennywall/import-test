      have trouble sitting still and watching TV let alone something as simple as reading a book or playing a card game. I think somewhat started with being young and somewhat ADHD.
    </p>I don't put the blame there, it lies with myself and my obsessive-compulsive personality and feeling a need to always have a business or startup and always striving to learn and be part of
    the latest trend. Now that I'm 36 and had some big shifts in my life I am retraining myself. Kaia and I laid around this morning and I read some of my book, we played cards, and just laid in bed
    and talked. This week I am going to take some more time in this area.

{% include JB/setup %}Excited to have started playing with the Google Wave Federation Protocol this evening. I got my sandbox account today and played with the client available there enough....then after going through the Google Wave API docs and Google Wave Federation Protocol Draft Specs again I am eager start playing with some code.
Going to play with some on my Amazon EC2 R&amp;D instance....then get to work on playing with a client some....see what damage I can do there.
Exciting stuff to see where we can take this for the event industry.
I downloaded TortoiseHG to work with the wave protocol mercurial repository.

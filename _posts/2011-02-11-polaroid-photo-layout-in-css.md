    Im working on several print photobook projects right now and Im always on the lookout for good CSS photo layouts.I came across a very well done tutorial called, How To Create a Pure CSS Polaroid
    Photo Gallery.I have modified somewhat for use as a photo book template, and published @ Github.I will be using this layout for several blog posts to come on building photo books with Flickr,
    Instagram and other photo sharing tools

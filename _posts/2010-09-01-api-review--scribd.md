I"m evaluating their potential for integration into applications. As I'm going through I"m also evaluating how they deliver their API community. I was checking out the <a href="http://www.scribd.com/developers"
        target="_blank">Scribd API</a> tonight, and I like their delivery. Its pretty straightforward. It has the following API building blocks:
</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>API Overview
     </li>

     <li>Sign Up for an API Account
     </li>

     <li>API Tutorials
     </li>

     <li>Client Libraries
     </li>

     <li>User Authentication Overview
     </li>

     <li>Usage Limits
     </li>

     <li>Javascript API
     </li>

     <li>Mobile and E-Reader API and SDK
     </li>

     <li>Enterprise SDK
     </li>

     <li>Help / Support
     </li>

     <li>FAQ
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     They make it easy to sign up for an API account by providing links in navigation and on home page. They provide client libraries in these programming language:
</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Ruby
     </li>

     <li>Java
     </li>

     <li>PHP
     </li>

     <li>C# / .NET
     </li>

     <li>ActionScript 3.0
     </li>

     <li>Python
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     They just make it easy to get up and going by providing the necessary information and tools. Its a good example to follow when deploying an API.

The DeltaCloud API provides a single API interface to work with multiple cloud computing providers.
With theDeltaCloud API you can start an instance on an internal cloud, then with the same code start another onAmazon EC2 orRackspace.
The DeltaCloud Core provides a RESTful API, and backward compatibility across different versions of support cloud platforms.
Deltacloud API supports the following providers:

	Amazon EC2
	GoGrid
	OpenNebula
	Rackspace
	RHEV-M
	RimuHosting

DeltaCloud is open-source and downloadable by anyone.
Currently there is no available DeltaCloud API as a service.  Anyone can download and deploy, but there is no Softare as a Service (SaaS) version.
I smell anopportunityfor someone to offer as a service, and provide an on-demand universal cloud computing web API.

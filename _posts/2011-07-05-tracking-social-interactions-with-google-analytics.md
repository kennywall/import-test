    <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/analytics/Google-Analytics-Social-Engagment.jpg" alt="" width="350" align="right" />I'm spending time this week <a title=
    "updating my social sharing buttons" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/07/updated-blog-sharing/">updating my social sharing buttons</a>, <a title=
    "claiming authorship of my blog posts, and linking with my Google profiles" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/07/claiming-my-blog-posts-and-social-profiles/">claiming authorship of my blog posts,
    and linking with my Google profiles</a>. A big part of this is also to update my <a title="Google Analytics to track social interactions" href=
    "http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/tracking/gaTrackingSocial.html">Google Analytics to track social interactions</a> with <a title="kinlane.com" href=
    "http://www.kinlane.com">kinlane.com</a> and <a title="blog.apievangelist.com" href="http://blog.apievangelist.com">blog.apievangelist.com</a>. If you have set up both Google +1 and the latest
    version of Google Analytics on the same page, all +1 social interactions will be tracked automatically. To get social interaction tracking and reporting for other networks like Facebook or
    Twitter, you need to integrate Google Analytics tracking along with each network button. Using Google Analytics Social Tracking, you can record interactions range from a Facebook "Like" to a
    Twitter "Tweet." This allows me to view track on these social interactions along with other traffic to my blogs, in my Google Analytics dashboard. I added tracking for Facebook recommendations:
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/1066419.js?file=gistfile1.txt">
</script>Also added tracking for Facebook shares:<script type="text/javascript" src="https://gist.github.com/1066428.js?file=gistfile1.txt">
</script>Then I added tracking for tweets: <script src="https://gist.github.com/1066430.js?file=gistfile1.txt" type="text/javascript">
</script>There were not ready to go scripts for tracking LinkedIn and StumbleUpon. I will be working on these as I can, so that I can track shares from my blogs to these social networking and
bookmark sites.

    be printed layer by layer using one of four potential 3D printing processes and corresponding materials:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>
        <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_laser_sintering">Selective Laser Sintering (SLS)</a></strong> - SLS is an additive manufacturing technique that uses a high power laser
        to fuse small particles of plastic, metal, ceramic, or glass powders into a mass that has a desired 3-dimensional shape.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereolithography">Stereolithography (SLA)</a></strong> - Stereolithography is an additive manufacturing process using a vat of liquid UV-curable
        photopolymer resin and a UV laser to build parts a layer at a time. On each layer, the laser beam traces a part cross-section pattern on the surface of the liquid resin.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fused_deposition_modeling">Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)</a></strong> - FDM works on an additive principle by laying down material in layers. A
        plastic filament or metal wire is unwound from a coil and supplies material to an extrusion nozzle which can turn on and off the flow.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminated_object_manufacturing">Laminate Object Manufacturing (LOM)</a></strong> - LOM is a rapid prototyping system that layers adhesive-coated
        paper, plastic, or metal laminates are successively glued together and cut to shape with a knife or laser cutter.
      </li>
    </ul>These are four of the common 3D printing methodologies and since the introduction of metal, 3D printing has moved past prototyping and art and has become a viable manufacturing technology.
    3D printing processes and materials are the link that allows virtual to become physical in the <a title="3D print and manufacturing supply chain" href=

     When I start my day I tend to open one browser and deploy all my work / business related applications and one browser for all my personal related applications. My personal browser tabs have been:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Gmail
     </li>
     <li>Google Calendar w/ Google Tasks Bar
     </li>
     <li>Google News which switches to Google Reader after the morning
     </li>
     <li>Facebook
     </li>
     <li>Wordpress (www.kinlane.com)
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     It has been this way for a while. I am now noticing a new shift in my personal default browser setup. I am seeing the following apps:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Gmail
     </li>
     <li>Google Voice
     </li>
     <li>Google Wave
     </li>
     <li>Google Calendar w/ Google Tasks Bar
     </li>
     <li>Google News which switches to Google Reader after the morning
     </li>
     <li>Facebook
     </li>
     <li>LinkedIn
     </li>
     <li>Wordpress (www.kinlane.com)
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     This is just what I have open by default in my Firefox browser. There are more tools I use as desktop apps as well as apps for the business. I will work on outlining these later.

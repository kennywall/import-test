{% include JB/setup %}<p>I like my new Google Profile.  Its a cleaner, more organized version of its former self.

I see the Google Social Network coming together in slow motion around my existing Google applications.
Its not the walled garden method of Facebook.  I would call it a rolling meadows method, where the different pieces are hills apart at moment, but are slowly being connected.
Google Profile has all the basic social network profile elements:   Info, Pics, Links and Social Stream with Buzz.
It has location baked in, and I can see them introducing the ability to add tabs for other applications next.
I think Google has a much wider view of what the future of social network is, its going to take some time to come into focus.

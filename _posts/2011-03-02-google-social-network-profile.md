     I like my new <a title="Google Profile" href="https://profiles.google.com/kinlane/about">Google Profile</a>. Its a cleaner, more organized version of its former self. <a title="Google Profile" href="https://profiles.google.com/kinlane/about"><img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google/Kin-Lane-Google-Profile.png" alt="" width="550" align="center" /></a> I see the Google Social Network coming together in slow motion around my existing Google applications. Its not the walled garden method of Facebook. I would call it a rolling meadows method, where the different pieces are hills apart at moment, but are slowly being connected. <a title="Google Profiles" href="http://www.google.com/profiles">Google Profile</a> has all the basic social network profile elements: Info, Pics, Links and Social Stream with Buzz. It has location baked in, and I can see them introducing the ability to add tabs for other applications next. I think Google has a much wider view of what the future of social network is, its going to take some time to come into focus.

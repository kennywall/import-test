Had a meetup with a fellow developer friend of mine.  He has been programming for years, but in the last 3-4 years become a real linux distribution and deployment expert.  He works primarily on developing very specialized linux installs for specific purposes such as mail server, spam filtering, specialized web applications, and very focused utility solutions.We are going to be working together to offer extremely specialized linux EC2 installations.I have really got excited over the various possiblities for EC2 deployments for speciality need such as scalable Facebook applications, gaming server environments, utility processing, LDAP, data warehousing and much more.So look for more to come on what is possible on the EC2 platform.

I was looking for a network device discovery tool.
I want something that will run at the command line on multiple platforms.
I came acrossFing from Overlook.
Fing is acommand line tool for network and service discovery.
It can detect wireless and wired devices.
It saves network device discovery results to a log file or to a CSV format.
Fing runs on Windows Linux and Mac.  You can download Fing from the Overlook site..

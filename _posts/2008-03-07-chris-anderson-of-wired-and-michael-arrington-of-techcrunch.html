Was just watching and enjoying a show of <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/home">Charlie Rose</a> that had  <a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/about.html">Chris Anderson of Wired</a> and Michael Arrington of <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/">TechCrunch</a>.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.thelongtail.com/about.html">Chris</a> was very informative and I'll have to watch again.<br /><br />Michael Arrington was impressive.   He covered tech as social issues in a way that kept me listening.<br /><br />Will write more about.  Good show guys.

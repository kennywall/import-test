{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im watching the future of manufacturing and printing unfold slowly in front of us.Im paying attention to 3D printing solutions evolving from companies like Shapeways, MakerBot, Materialise, ZCorp, and Objet.At the same time Im involved with the rollout of Google Cloud Print Services Interface, an API for managing printing to any printer over the Internet.Im using Google Docs as a publishing platform, integrating Google Cloud Print with the Mimeo Connect API and evolving whats possible with commercial cloud printing.Google has added support for many more native file formats in Google Docs.</p>

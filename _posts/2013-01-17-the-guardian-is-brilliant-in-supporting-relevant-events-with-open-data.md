<p>
     I’m a big fan of what <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/data">The Guardian is doing with their data and API strategy</a>. I think they are a model for what old media should be doing around the globe.
</p>
<p>
     When they post stories, I tend to take a look, not because of the story, but their data driven approach to reporting.  
</p>
<p>
     A great example of this, is yesterday's helicopter crash on top of a residential building construction project in London, killing two people and injuring 13 others.
</p>
<p>
     The Guardian provides not just the overview of the story with data visualizations and summary, but of course you can download the data behind.
</p>
<p>
     The process is brilliant, because it rides the waves of popular stories, but also provides valuable data behind--which creates value as well as page views.
</p>
<p>
     Which I think will have a greater long-tail than just page view exhaust.

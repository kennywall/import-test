     I’m working through the 2012 year, <a href="http://personaldata.apievangelist.com/">trying to quantify what I did over the year</a>. It’s not as easy as it sounds. One area I’m having trouble quantifying is how much programming I do.
</p>
<p>
     Programming is an essential variable in my happiness algorithm. If I’m not programming a certain amount each week on projects, I can get very grumpy. ;(
</p>
<p>
     There is an easy way to track how many projects or side projects I’m working on, and how much programming time each of these projects get--using <a title="Github" href="http://github.com">Github</a>. The problem is I still don’t use Github 100% of the time. I still code many side projects in the doldrums of my Amazon EC2 server(s).
</p>
<p>
     So in 2013, I am going to make Github repositories default for all side projects. Each project will start off as a repository, then I will enhance using:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Github Pages - Running a static site framework on Github, with subdomain
     </li>
     <li>Jekyll - Pages and blogs for each project running using Github Pages
     </li>
     <li>Disqus - Open up casual commenting on each project
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Every project will be open source by default and allow for interaction and collaboration at two levels using Disqus or Github.
</p>
<p>
     Anyone can easily leave a comment with Disqus or fork the project and commit at a deeper level.
</p>
<p>
     All of my projects will be open by default, and can easily be linked off any of my main websites and blogs.
</p>
<p>
     Additionally I will be able to track the number of side projects I work on, how active each one is, and how much code I commit any given day, week, month or throughout the year.
</p>
<p>
     While I can’t easily quantity how much time I programmed in 2012, in 2013 I will have the data necessary, with just a simple shift in how I manage myself.

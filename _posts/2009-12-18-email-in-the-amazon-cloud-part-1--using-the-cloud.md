    Amazon is a great place to really take care of business when it comes to IT.First order of business at my new job last year was to take care of a really troubling hostage situation with their
    current server co-location contract.My boss said, move us to the cloud.I had used Amazon Web Services before, I thought I should check out other providers as well.So I toured a handful of cloud
    providers, but ended up back with Amazon Web Services.

I came across a blog post in the Huffington Post called, "Schwarzenegger Proposes Budget For 'Tough Times'". So I went and checked out the California Proposed Budget for 2010 and 2011.
I am seeing a lot of PDF documents available regarding the budget, but no data feeds or spreadsheets.
I went ahead and plugged the California Budget into the budget priority tool I have been building.
You view the California Budget Prioritization Tool i built and register for your own account.
The hardest part about plugging these budgets into the prioritization tool is getting the budget data normalized. Everything else is smooth.

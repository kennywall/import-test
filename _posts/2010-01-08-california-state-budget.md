     I came across a blog post in the Huffington Post called, "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/08/schwarzenegger-proposes-b_n_416750.html">Schwarzenegger Proposes Budget For 'Tough Times</a>'". So I went and checked out the <a href="Schwarzenegger%20Proposes%20Budget%20For%20'Tough%20Times'">California Proposed Budget for 2010 and 2011</a>. I am seeing a lot of PDF documents available regarding the budget, but no data feeds or spreadsheets. I went ahead and plugged the <a href="http://californiabudget.laneworks.net/index.php">California Budget</a> into the <a href="http://californiabudget.laneworks.net/index.php">budget priority</a> tool I have been building. You view the <a href="http://californiabudget.laneworks.net/index.php">California Budget Prioritization Tool</a> i built and register for your own account. The hardest part about plugging these budgets into the prioritization tool is getting the budget data normalized. Everything else is smooth.

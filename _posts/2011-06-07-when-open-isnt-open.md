    I spend time each day monitoring how technology is impacting various industries.APIs are playing a major role in evolving how business is done in just about any sector.In my search for new APIs
    and technologies for the print and publishing industry I came across a new community called Open Xerox.Open Xerox is a web portal that hosts technology prototypes from the Xerox R&amp;D labs,
    making them accessible to external user community for review and comment before the launch of a product offering.The site speaks in all the tags Im interested in: converter, document, analysis,
    ebook, epub, ereader, language, pdf, simple text.

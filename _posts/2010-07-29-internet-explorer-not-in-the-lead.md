Check out these browser statistics taken from my blog for traffic over the last 30 days:

  * Firefox - 40.55%
  * Chrome - 30.86%
  * Safari - 11.90%
  * Internet Explorer - 11.19%
Of course my audience is made up of mostly geeks (and my mom), but it sure is good to see even Safari kicking Internet Explorers butt!!

{% include JB/setup %}I have this great public profile showing all my stuff.Now of course I want analytics for all of this.  I want to know who is looking at what.  What is most popular and what is not.Show me which images were looked at today, what audio people heard.I want to be able to do this all without having to grab a piece of code from my Google analytics and paste it on a site.I just want to know.

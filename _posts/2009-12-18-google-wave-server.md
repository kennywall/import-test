{% include JB/setup %}I was going through the different areas of my Google Wave research this evening. It was time to learn more about the Google Wave Federated Protocol. I just haven't had enough time to keep reading on the subject.
So to update my research:

	Google released their open source version of the Google Wave Federation Prototype Server.
	PyGoWave Server is still going strong too.

I don't see any other offerings at this point. The Google release is a Java application that conforms to XEP-0114, the Jabber Component Protocol. Without Java resources this isn't much of an option for me.
PyGoWave Server is my best option. It is a Python implementation. I am not an expert in Python but I have dabbled. I would like to see a PHP Google Wave Server.
So I am diving into the Google Wave Architecture documentation some more to get a stronger grasp of the Google Wave Federation Architecture and  Google Wave Data Model and Client-Server Protocol.

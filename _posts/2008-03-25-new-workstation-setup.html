I just got a new levovo Laptop.  It was presetup with Windows XP.<br /><br />It took me 30 minutes flat to setup completely for my needs.<br /><ol class="mainlist"><li>Installed my web development environment.</li><li>Installed my database development environment.</li><li>Installed Windows Live Messenger, and Yahoo Messenger.</li><li>Installed Firefox.<br /></li></ol>Done, everything else I do is web-based.  All my email, docs, files, everything is either on Google, Amazon Web Services or some other Web Service.<br /><br />Almost there in accomplishing my goal in living online.<br /><br />Man I love it.

I was just playing with a cool new, free photo collage tool called Photovisi.
With Photovisi you can select one of the many layout designs, add your photos and then customize by dragging items around.
After the collage is finished, it's available for download as a .jpg file.
Once you download a photo collage, you can easily print by saving the .jpg as a .pdf using the Mimeo Print Driver, then build posters and photo books using Mimeo.com
Photovisi also offers a Facebook version of their collage application for working with Facebook photos.

     <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/other/PhotoVisi.png"  width="250" align="right" />I was just playing with a cool new, free photo collage tool called <a title="Photovisi" href="http://www.photovisi.com/">Photovisi</a>.
</p>

<p>
     With Photovisi you can select one of the many <a title="layout designs" href="http://www.photovisi.com/gallery">layout designs</a>, add your photos and then customize by dragging items around.
</p>

<p>
     After the collage is finished, it's available for download as a .jpg file.
</p>

<p>
     Once you download a photo collage, you can easily print by saving the .jpg as a .pdf using the <a title="Mimeo Print Driver" href="http://www.mimeo.com/printer/">Mimeo Print Driver</a>, then build posters and photo books using <a title="Mimeo.com" href="http://www.mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a>
</p>

<p>
     Photovisi also offers a <a title="Facebook version of their collage application" href="http://apps.facebook.com/photovisi/">Facebook version of their collage application</a> for working with Facebook photos.

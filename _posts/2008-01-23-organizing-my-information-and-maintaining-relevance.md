{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have talked a little about how I organize my information using the Google Platform.  I use Google Reader and Google Notebook to do all my research and thought gathering. I then use Google Docs to group and further refine my thoughts. I am working more with using the collaboration features to work with others to refine these thoughts in Google Docs as well.I have a constant problem with information and topics I would like to keep relevant getting buried and forgot about, and unless I search for them I don't remember.I have discovered the Blogger is kind of my validation of my thoughts and ideas and anything that makes it to Blogger has a kind of higher value on my network.My tagging structure and and posts gives me a kind of index to my higher thoughts.</p>

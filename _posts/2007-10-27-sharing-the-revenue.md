{% include JB/setup %}<p>That is awesome that there are social media sites and networks starting to share the revenue with their top content generators.Lets go a step further.How about you pay me for all valid, professional interaction I have.I should be able to generate video, audio, files, pictures, etc and post them places and share in the revenue from these either being sold or ad revenue from eyeballs.I want to be able to take part in networks and spread the word through linking, commenting, and other forms and for every action I take it works towards and overall return in cash or other compensation.</p>

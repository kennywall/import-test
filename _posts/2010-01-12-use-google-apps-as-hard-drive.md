    Over the next few weeks Google is rolling out the ability to upload all file types to the cloud through Google Docs, giving you one place where you can upload and access your key files
    online.Google Docs now supports files up to 250 MB in size, which is larger than the attachment limit on most email applications, youll be able to backup large graphics files, RAW photos, ZIP
    archives and much more to the cloud.Now instead of carrying a USB drive, you can now use Google Docs as a more convenient option for accessing your files on different computers.Google is taking a
    big step to be at the center of everyones online office.Update (02-07-2010): I started using Gladinet to map a network drive to my Google and Google Apps accounts.

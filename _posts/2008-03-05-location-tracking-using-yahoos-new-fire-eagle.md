{% include JB/setup %}I was checking out Yahoo's new release, Fire Eagle.  It is a secure and stylish way to share your location with sites and services online while giving you control over your data and privacy. Applications and users can respond to your location and help you to discover more about the world around you in real time.It has an API allowing applications to be developed that will allow you to interact online based upon your location.  This could be huge and bring the type of innovation that Google Maps gave us.Definitely a scary thing for a lot of users, however the younger crowd will embrace.Stowe Boyd got an early invite and has some nice screen shots of Fire Eagle.

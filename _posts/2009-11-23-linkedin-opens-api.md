{% include JB/setup %}<p>LinkedIn finally opened up their API to the world.It gives you authentication, profile, and network access to LinkedIn Profiles.It is definitely a step forward.Unfortunately I am looking for access to the events, question and answer, and group access through the API as well.Also I would like access to the LinkedIn application platform too!</p>

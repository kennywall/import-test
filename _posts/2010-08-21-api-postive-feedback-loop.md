     A positive feedback loop can occur whenever an API becomes popular, it keeps becoming more and more popular due to network effects. The most important network effects are:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>API gets support by partners
     </li>
     <li>API gets support by vendors
     </li>
     <li>Developers are more likely to already know how to use it.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     This feedback loop and network effect are the momentum you need to create in your API community. I'm working through this thought extracted from <a href="http://blog.wolfire.com/2010/01/Why-you-should-use-OpenGL-and-not-DirectX" target="_blank">Why you should use OpenGL and not DirectX</a>.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just installed the Google Web Clipboard in my Google Chrome browser.It allows me to store text and HTML content and access it across any Google Apps.I like the concept of having a single cloud based clip-board.I use Snippely for my code snippets, which I would like to see be cloud-based.Now if Google would just create a simple IDE for the Google Apps suite I would be rockn!</p>

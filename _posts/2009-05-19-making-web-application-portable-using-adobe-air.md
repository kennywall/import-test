{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am enjoying taking a current web application and making it run in Adobe Air.So far I have quickly ported an existing ColdFusion web application over to run within a downloadable Adobe Air application.It runs as it does in the browser with a few modifications.It is completely dependent on an internet connection.Next I will be playing with the underlying data model and see what I can as far as replicating its database locally and run off a local database and sync with live when an Internet connection is available.</p>

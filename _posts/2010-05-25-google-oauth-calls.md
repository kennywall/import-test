{% include JB/setup %}<p>While working with the Google API tonight I registered my primary research and development domain with them so that I could make oAuth calls to Google API.
You need to go to: https://www.google.com/accounts/ManageDomains
You need to register your application with Google. Using this page, you can identify your web domain(s) . Once you've successfully registered your domain, you will be able to programmatically access Google data on behalf of your users.
This new, automated registration process has three steps:

	Verify administrator access to the domain.
	Accept terms of service. At this point, your domain is active but not yet registered.
	Set up domain properties and provide authentication certificate.

For those of you familiar with oAuth its pretty standard. Just is a little difficult to find within the Google universe.</p>

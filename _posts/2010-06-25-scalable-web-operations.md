I was just reading thoughts on scalable web operations, observations/thoughts on web operations collected from a few sessions at Velocity conference 2010.
Interesting points:

	Optimization
	Tools
	Cookies
	Datastores
	Automation
	Revision control
	Networking
	Caching
	People
	Systems
	Moderation

I'm reviewing these areas against two areas of research, small business cloud operations and HTML5.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been getting a lot of questions from users regarding how to manage their Google Cloud Printers.
To help guide users stumbling across my site, there are two types of Google Cloud Print Users:

	End Users - You are installing Google Cloud Print on your Windows machine to print to it on your mobile phone.
	Developers - Developers building Google Cloud Print Proxies and Cloud Print Aware Printers.

I'm in the developer camp. My register cloud printer or my delete cloud printer blog posts won't help end users much, they are for developers.
If you are looking to manage your cloud printers and print jobs, go to the Google Cloud Print Interface. It lets you:

	See your Google Cloud Printers
	Delete your Google Cloud Printers
	See shared Google Cloud Printers

TheGoogle Cloud Print Interface also lets you manage print jobs for your Google Cloud Printers:

	See active print jobs
	Delete active print jobs
	See completed print jobs
	Delete completed print jobs

If you are an end user theGoogle Cloud Print Interface is where you want to me. You won't get far with my Google Cloud Printer PHP tutorials.
Also, if you want to uninstall Google Cloud Print from your machine, you will have to do that under your Control Panel on your Windows workstation.

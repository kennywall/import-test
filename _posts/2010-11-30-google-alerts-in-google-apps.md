{% include JB/setup %}<p>Google is rapidly retooling many of the FREE applications weve come to know, and launching within the Google Apps cloud platform.They released Google Alerts in the Google Apps area today, allowing you to setup alerts within your companies domain.I use Google Alerts to help me discover new information on a daily basis.The keywords and phrases I search for change from week to week depending on my focus, currently they are:

	Print on Demand
	Print
	Publishing
	Cloud Computing
	Application Programming Interface

Google Alerts help me discover new blogs, sites and other information in these areas.It has become a primary method of discovery for me in my busy schedule, delivered in my inbox every evening.</p>

     <img class="alignnone c1" title="Youtube" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/youtube-250x250.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /><a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> is an amazing site. I spend a lot of time there browsing mostly music and training videos. I am impressed with the number of features they have introduced over the years. They just released their latest feature that allows you to <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/06/edit-video-online-with-youtube-video.html">edit video online using the Youtube Video Editor</a>. I would have put Youtube in the Platform as a Service (PaaS) category a long time ago with their API and embed tools. However with the ability to edit videos online they truly have graduated to a mature cloud video platform. Why would you build your own when you can use <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>.

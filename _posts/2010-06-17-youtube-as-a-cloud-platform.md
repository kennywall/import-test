{% include JB/setup %}<p>YouTube is an amazing site.I spend a lot of time there browsing mostly music and training videos.I am impressed with the number of features they have introduced over the years.They just released their latest feature that allows you to edit video online using the Youtube Video Editor.I would have put Youtube in the Platform as a Service (PaaS) category a long time ago with their API and embed tools.</p>

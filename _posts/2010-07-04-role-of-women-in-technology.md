     As a big dumb white guy, I often fall into the common trap that is set in our society. The trap that white men rule. I get to play dumb to the fact that there is injustice in the world. I've worked with clients where everything is perfect as long as I'm managing the project. As soon as I bring in my right hand (a woman), or my development support, things can go wrong. I (the big dumb white guy) need a constant wake up call (daily) about the "world" I live in. You may feel comfortable in your skin, but there is a lot more going on around you. There is much more influencing you than you may know. You have a lot of control to influence your "buddies", make sure and pay attention. Give credit where credit is due, <a href="http://www.audreywatters.com/2010/07/04/women-had-nothing-to-do-with-the-founding-of-the-web-says-mashable/" target="_blank">women were just as responsible for the foundation of the Internet as men</a>.

{% include JB/setup %}I use the "Google Platform" to help me build and evolve my central "content platform".  For either one project or across all of them.I too am a software developer so I approach very similar.I have been using Google Platform to organize and publish my thoughts for some time now.  I have wanted to start blogging on how I do this and work to organize my thoughts in a way I can share with others.  I was reading Development Approaches to Writing?, by Fred Stutzman today about his development process approach to writing.  So let me start with a basic post about this and I will work to refine.Everything starts in Google Notebook, because I can harvest from a web page or blog with just a right click and it keeps the reference to the original piece.  I can also just capture my own thoughts as I am surfing using my firefox add-in as well.I can then organize these "notes" into notebooks by relevancy.  I can further refine and handle the evolution by scripts using the Google Notebook API.Then as information and throughts mature I migrate to Google Docs with a simple right click in Google Notebook.Once in Google Docs I can refine more formally and with the assistance of others if necessary through collaboration.Then I can also organize data in spreadsheets and evolve aspects into presentations.From there I can publish to blogger, PDF, a book or whatever publishing format I wish.I like the Google Platform because of how the applications compliment and work together, however the API is the biggest piece that allows me to work with things programmatically using scripts.

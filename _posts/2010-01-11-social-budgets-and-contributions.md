{% include JB/setup %}<p>Many projects I do in my spare time are purely for the exercise and learning experience.I have been developing a tool I am calling social budgets.I am very political, but I get frustrated when I dont fully understand what is going on at a state and federal level.I like to have a deep understanding before I take action or even open my mouth.So I wanted to understand where the State of Oregon is spending their money and create a way I can voice my opinion on my priorities.</p>

{% include JB/setup %}<p>Just came across Google's New AJAX Libraries API.  I was wondering when someone was going to merge together all the common JavaScript libraries out there into a single set of libraries. The AJAX Libraries API is a content distribution network and loading architecture for the most popular open source JavaScript libraries. By using the Google AJAX API Loader's google.load() method, your application has high speed, globaly available access to a growing list of the most popular JavaScript open source libraries including: jQueryprototypescript.aculo.usMooToolsdojo</p>

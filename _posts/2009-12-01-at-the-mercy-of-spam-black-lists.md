    SPAM black lists come in very handy for filtering out servers that potentially are sending SPAM. However every once in a while I get a server listed and I get stuck in hell. Our primary mail
    server got black listed yesterday at some point, and it happens to be a black list that SAP references. So of course no emails will go to our biggest client. I requested with <a href=
    "http://www.mail-abuse.com/">Trend Micro MAPS</a> to have us removed yesterday at 5:00 PM. Here it is 5:00 PM the following day and all I have is a generic case number for the problem. Nobody to
    talk to. No action. Many black lists will remove us within one hour of requesting to be off. I understand and respect the value of these services. However when their support and response side of
    their services fail. They are hurting honest businesses and causing a lot of problems. C'mon guys. Answer please.

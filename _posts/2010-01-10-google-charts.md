     I wanted to reintroduce everyone to Google Charts. If you haven't heard about it, it is a quick and easy way to create chart from data sources. It is so easy to use. I think it is a tool that more people need to hear about and understand how they can easily use to embed charts in web pages, word documents, pdfs, spreadsheets and much more. To create a chart, all you do is pass your data and labels for the data using a URL or web site address: http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?cht=p3&amp;chd=t:60,40&amp;chs=250x100&amp;chl=Hello|World The Google Chart API then returns a .png image representation of your data. You can choose the chart type and size as well as dynamically pass your data to be presented in the chart or graph. I am finding new uses for it everyday to quickly add visuals to blogs, web sites and emails that I do daily. Visuals go a long way.

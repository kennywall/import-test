     I have been answering a lot of questions on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a> lately about where the best place to store data in the clouds. There are a lot of answers to this question. Cloud storage comes in many shapes, sizes, and prices. Business class, personal usage, storage APIs and much more. I store my:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/">Amazon EC2</a> machine images in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>
     </li>
     <li>Server data, logs and files in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>
     </li>
     <li>Personal workstation back ups in <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>
     </li>
     <li>Images on <a href="http://picasa.google.com/">Picasa</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a>, and Zip up originals and upload to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a>
     </li>
     <li>Documents (Word, PDF, Spreadsheets) in Google Docs (FREE and Google App)
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I overwhelmingly use Amazon S3. I get my data there using 3 different methods:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a href="https://www.jungledisk.com/">Jungle Disk</a> Backups and Mapped Network Drives
     </li>
     <li>Firefox <a href="http://www.s3fox.net/">S3 Fox</a> Add-On
     </li>
     <li>
          <a href="http://www.crossftp.com/">Cross FTP Client</a>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Jungle disk does most of the heavy lifting. With most of my individual interactions using a mapped drive with <a href="https://www.jungledisk.com/">Jungle Disk</a> and <a href="http://www.s3fox.net/">S3 Fox</a> in Firefox. I don't feel <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> is best storage solution for every person or business. I choose it primarily because it allows me to store data:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>From Automated Back Ups
     </li>
     <li>Manually
     </li>
     <li>Programmatically in Web Applications
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Most importantly because I have control over my data. I've been up there over over 2 years now. I've never lost any data. I pay a low price and I know I own my data. It won't disappear when the start-up goes out of business or is acquired. I keep my business files, taxes, music, photos, videos and much more up there. My data is important, and I will pay to keep it organized in one place in clouds. <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3/">Amazon S3</a> has overwhelmingly won over my continued business.

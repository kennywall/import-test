I work real hard to read and learn more each day about emerging trends and technologies. There is a lot of information in my head about all this. However putting it down for others to use and understand is extremely difficult for me. It is a constant challenge.
Then I come across post by Dion Hinchliffe's blog postings. He constantly amazes me in his ability to articulate this stuff. Through words and his wonderful, distinct visuals.
I came across 3 postings of his today that I think you all should read:

	50 Essential Strategies For Creating A Successful Web 2.0 Product
	Ten Aspects of Web 2.0 Strategy That Every CTO and CIO Should Know
	How to Survive and Thrive in Business Today with Web 2.0 - Part 1

If you need to get your bearings in all this social media, social networking and new media world...pay attention to Dion and his blog.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I like using whiteboards to sketch out ideas.  I love drawing elaborate graphs and visuals to try and convey my point. I usually take pictures of my drawings so I have a digital copy, and I have even played with a few smartboards that record my drawings.I came across a web 2.0 whiteboard created by GE today called Imagination Cubed.  It is pretty cool. Just a well done simple application.  You can draw your thoughts and play it back and email it to people as well.Give it a try.</p>

{% include JB/setup %}<p>As a startup, you are bound to reach a point in your evolution where money will blind you, whether its during roadmap planning or communicating with your customers--eventually you will be blinded by your investors.Once you&rsquo;ve taken on enough investment, or the load of the parent company who acquired, you will start seeing things differently.You won&rsquo;t see your users the same way anymore, this will be reflected in how you deliver features, or structure your roadmap--it isn&rsquo;t about users anymore, it is about profit.Once you enter this phase your imagination goes away, and you work to speak in terms that your investors understand.This is where I feel Instagram is at.</p>

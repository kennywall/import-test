{% include JB/setup %}I was just reading about CentriLogic's new cloud hosting services. They store your data across data centers in Rochester NY, Buffalo NY, Toronto ON, and Mississauga, ON.
With Amazon EC2 and cloudfront distributions you can deploy your data across United States, European, Hong Kong and Singapore, and Japan edge locations.

Interested in how Data Protection Regulations affect IT operations, cloud computing and cloud storage you can read Forrester's research on the significance of data protection regulations in the cloud:

	 Infrastructure-As-A-Service (IaaS) Clouds Are Local And So Are Their Implications, Know Where Your Cloud Is Before Deploying by James Staten and Onica King
	As IaaS Cloud Adoption Goes Global, Tech Vendors Must Address Local Concerns, Infrastructure-As-A-Service Clouds Are Local, And So Are Their Implications by Jennifer Belissent, Ph.D.

Seems like you could make a cloud storage provider that just catered to the regulatory needs of various companies and the types of content they need to store and industries they are part of.

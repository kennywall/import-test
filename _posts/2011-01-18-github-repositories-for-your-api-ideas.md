{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im still working on the deployment of the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API area.In the mean time I am preparing a lot of content to publish when its ready.I am noticing that code samples are common elements across my blog post, application directory and even some of my print ideas.Some code samples stand on their own, but most are inter-wined with blogs, how tos, and other content.Ive started using github for all the code libraries used in my API Area.</p>

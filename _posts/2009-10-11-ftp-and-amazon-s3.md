{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just playing with a cross FTP tool that allows you to setup your FTP and Amazon S3 connections side by side in the same client.I do a lot of FTPing as well as moving data to Amazon S3.Interesting concept.will play with more and see if it can become a regularly used tool in my toolbox.Check it out at CrossFTP.</p>

    In a little over three weeks Google has released 14 of their regular web applications as part of the Google Apps cloud platform.Now in addition to the core email, docs, calendar, sites, and chat
    you have 14 new web applications: Google Custom Search Google Website Optimizer Google Checkout Google Analytics Google Places Google SketcUp &amp; 3D Warehouse Google Translator Toolkit Youtube
    Google Alerts Google Adwords Google Finance Blogger Google Voice Google Reader I have been waiting for a couple of these apps to be added, like Google Reader and Google Voice.A few of the other
    just make sense, you want to have your Checkout, Analytics and Adwords part of your core business business account.All of these apps, plus the Google Apps Marketplace really makes Google Apps a
    complete business platform.

    Google responded to everyone on the Gmail blog about some of the open questions around Google Buzz.They addressed some of the privacy concerns around your Google Contacts and how your Buzz
    network operates.They cover: More visible option to not show followers/people you follow on your public profile Ability to block anyone who starts following you More clarity on which of your
    followers/people you follow can appear on your public profile I like how they closed it: We designed Buzz to make it easy to connect with others and have conversations about things that interest
    you, and its great to see millions of you doing this already.Its still early, and we have a long list of improvements on the way.We look forward to hearing more suggestions and will continue to
    improve the Buzz experience with user transparency and control top of mind.

A <a title="new concept IPhone case" href="http://www.yankodesign.com/2011/05/02/iphone-case-is-a-polaroid-printer/">new concept IPhone case</a> from <a title="Mac Funamizu" href="http://www.yankodesign.com/?s=%22mac+funamizu%22&amp;x=31&amp;y=19&amp;lang=en">Mac Funamizu</a> prints photos just like a Poloraoid. Using a QR code and geo tagged map the printed picture can also be linked to a digital version on the web. A ery intriguing concept that merges new and old into a very usable piece of technology.

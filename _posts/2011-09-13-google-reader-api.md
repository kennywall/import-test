{% include JB/setup %}<p>One thing I love about Google, is the APIs.The apps I use most like Gmail, Calendar and Docs all have APIs, allowing me to write code that works my accounts and its data, and integrate it into other applications.Well except for one application, Google Reader.Google has never made an API for Google Reader.It onlyallowsyou to use RSS feeds and sharing them publicly.</p>

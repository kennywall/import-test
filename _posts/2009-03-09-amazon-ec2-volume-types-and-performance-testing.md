{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have not had much time to do performance testing on our recent Amazon EC2 environment.We got our entire company migrated and stabilized in a completely Amazon Web Services based environment.And so far I love it.So I am very thankful I came across this performance testing of different types of file system configurations setup on Amazon volumes.Checkout the Amazon Performance Testing here.</p>

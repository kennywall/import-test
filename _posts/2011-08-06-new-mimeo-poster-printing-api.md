    When developers come toMimeo Connect, they tend to have one thing in mind--printing from their application.TheMimeo Connect Cloud Print APIallows you to print a lot of different type of business
    documents, but usually developers have a specific type in mind.Because of this many developers dont have the time to setup their Mimeo.com accounts, and build the documents they are looking to
    print.They just want to print.

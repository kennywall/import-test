{% include JB/setup %}<p>I wrote a post yesterday on the Amazon outage, and half jokingly saidAmazon Should Pull Plug Regularly to Show Which Companies Do Not Have It Together.Of course I dont think Amazon should do this, but I wanted to highlight Clays great post on the topic.I wanted to take another side of the outage now.About 6 months ago I responded to a good friends request for advice on moving to the cloud.His has been an ISP since the early days of the Internet.</p>

      In the tech space we use the term dashboard a lot. Think about how overused that term is when delivering web applications, portals, home page, start page and any other bullshit incarnation on
      the Internet where you heard the term dashboard applied to!
    </p>
    <p>
      We place a lot of demands on these digital dashboards. They should only display exactly the information we need. We need to be able to hide, show and reorder all the elements of the dashboard
      as we see fit. We need skins and other ways to customize the way our dashboard looks. Our dashboards should be personalized to our everyday lives.

    <p>
      Now think about the dashboard in your car. How much control over this dashboard do you have? &nbsp;Just wait until Ford, GM, BMW, Volkswagen, Toyota and other carmakers get their footing with
      APIs. It will be a different game!

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have been very fortunate in the past months to have attended some amazing tech community gatherings, featuring some very interesting minds of our time, including Elon Musk, Andy Bechtolsheim, and Mark Zuckerberg.One common theme I noticed from listening to thought leaders is how much innovation and cultivation of ideas occur in the coffee shops and beer pubs of our cities and towns.Coffee and beer seems to play a central role as an elixir in the collective technological R&amp;D of our current online world.As I write this post I am sitting in a Starbucks in Ukiah, CA.Audrey just finished a blog post on Gene Simmons, and is working on another application review.</p>

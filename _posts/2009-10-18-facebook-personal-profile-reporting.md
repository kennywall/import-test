Why don't I get some sort of traffic statistics for my Facebook profile? You get reporting if you buy advertising.

I would like to see statistics for my page views, image, video and links.

I should be able to see how many people are viewing my profile.

Maybe you shouldn't show "who" is visiting...but I would at least some sort of Google Analytics for it.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>Ive started exploring Google Books as a publishing platform for my books.I write my own books, but I want to explore what it looks like to be a publisher using Google Books and Mimeo Connect Cloud Print.As a publisher, Google Book allows me to:

	Increase awareness of my book titles
	Publish and promote at no cost
	Reach Googles worldwide user base
	Refer qualified traffic to my website
	Help Users Find Your Books

First I will be uploading my titles to Google Books as PDF, then by matching the content in my book with user searches, Google Books will connects my titles books with the users who are most interested in buying them.Each Google Books result will display the books title and author, a short excerpt containing the highlighted search terms, and other public data about the book.When a user clicks on one of my your book titles from a search results page, it takes users to a limited preview of the title - just enough to give them a taste of the book, as if they were browsing in a bookstore or library.</p>

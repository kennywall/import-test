Stumbling across several cool tools tonight. Came across this <a href="http://api.textmagic.com/">Bulk SMS Gateway</a>.
<p></p>So you can send <a href="text%20messages%20(SMS)%20using%20this%20API">text messages (SMS) using this API</a> and in addition you can also send text messages using email.
<p></p>The service is called <a href="text%20messages%20(SMS)%20using%20this%20API">TextMagic Bulk SMS Gateway</a>.
<p></p>They offer a Java, Ruby , PHP, Python, Perl code as part of their SDK to connect.
<p></p>Another really cool feature is you can use the API to check the delivery status of messages you sent.
<p></p>Very cool web service. I could its use come in handy in several situations. Text messaging is becoming a bigger part of events and conferences.

{% include JB/setup %}Taking an API from area to community takes a lot of work.   It just doesn't happen overnight.  It takes a perfect balance of technology, developers, partners, resources and hard work.

APIs are a big part of the future of a distributed workforce, and developer communities like Elance are building the workforce to support the APIs.  You can leverage the Elance platform to:

	Providing High Quality, Professional Developers
	Develop API SDK and Code Samples
	Develop API skills test and accreditation

I have developed this prototype API developer area, driven by the Elance community to show what is possible using the Elance API.
Using the power of the existing API developer community at Elance you can quickly take your API beyond community and build a living API ecosystem.

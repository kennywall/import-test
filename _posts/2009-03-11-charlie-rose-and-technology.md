{% include JB/setup %}I am really impressed with the Charlie Rose show lately. I have always enjoyed his show and his lineup of guests.
However in the last year his lineup of technology leaders and visionary is impressive.
What is even more impressive is his ability to know whats going on. He doesn't just have a list of quality questions. He actually knows what he is asking. He gets it.
He claims he's not a super savvy tech person but he comes off like he is. Someof the most notable interviews lately are:

	Marissa Mayer of Google - http://www.charlierose.com/view/clip/10136
	Eric Schmidt of Google - http://www.charlierose.com/view/clip/10139
	Michael Arrington of Techcrunch - http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/9973
	Andrew McAfee of Harvard Business School- http://www.charlierose.com/guest/view/6524
	Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn - http://www.charlierose.com/view/clip/10133

There are a few more I can't recall right now, and of course he has many other amazing non-techy guests.

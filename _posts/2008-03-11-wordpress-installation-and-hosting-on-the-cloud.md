Just got a request to install Wordpress blog for a client that will potentially receive a large amount of traffic.

So I opted to use the Mosso.com Cloud Hosting Platform by Rackspace. Took me less than 10 minutes to setup the site, install, and configure the Wordpress blog.

In my Mosso.com admin interface and added a new web site, chose to use PHP 5 as core technology and chose mysql as the database.


  * Once setup and created a MySQL database.
  * I FTP'ed the unzipped wordpress contents.
  * Updated the wp-config.php file.
  * Ran the install.

Then I was done. A scalable Wordpress installation that will handle a large volume of traffic and hosting is cheap. I could offer as low as $4.95 / month.

May just do that.

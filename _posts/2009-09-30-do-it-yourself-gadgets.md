    I was just checking out BUG Labs do it yourself DIY gadgets.They have created a sweet array of little open source programmable gadgets.For those of us who spent our youths taking apart stereos,
    tvs and anything that plugged in when we were little.these are cool.Here is what they are all about from their own site: Bug Labs is a new kind of technology company, enabling a new generation of
    engineers to tap their creativity and build any type of device they want, without having to solder, learn solid state electronics, or go to China.

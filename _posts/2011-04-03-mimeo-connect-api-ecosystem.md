     As I'm preparing to launch my new Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API area, I'm taking inventory of my ecosystem. Granted, its not a true "ecosystem" yet. I call it that, because I hope my efforts will yield a self-sustaining cloud printing API ecosystem. Mimeo ecosystem areas are: Mimeo My Mimeo Mimeo Marketplace Mimeo Lounge Knowledge Base Mimeo Connect ecosystem consists of: Mimeo Connect Overview Developer Area (Not updated with my new area yet) My Mimeo Sandbox External ecosystem consists of: Twitter LinkedIn Github Google Code (many projects, don't have single profile like Github) Stack Exchange I'm just getting going on all of my Mimeo Connect and external ecosystem pieces, so until I launch my new area they are limited in information. This is just the version 1.0 of my roadmap for my Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API ecosystem.

     Google Gears or the Offline Settings is what had screwed up my Gmail (Google Apps) left hand menu bar. I just turned offline off for Gmail and my menu went back to normal. Well that is a big deterrent for me to use the offline settings, for some reason it just made me angry to look at the screen when it was all jacked up.

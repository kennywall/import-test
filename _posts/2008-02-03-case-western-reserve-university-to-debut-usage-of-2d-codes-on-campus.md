    I was turned to an article about usage of QR Codes on Campus over at 2d-code.co.uk.Beginning February 1st 2008, students, faculty and staff at Case Western Reserves Cleveland, Ohio, campus will
    be participating in the nations first trial of 2D codes�commonly referred to as QR Codes�by bringing the cell phone technology to campus.The 2D codes, first introduced on campus during fall
    orientation will be used as a link to mobile content in the form of pictures, music, videos, news articles and other interactive media.

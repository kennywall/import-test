    Foursquare just&nbsp;took another step with local recommendations&nbsp;by launching a new web version of&nbsp;Foursquare Explore.Last March during SXSW 2011,&nbsp;Foursquare launched&nbsp;explore
    for&nbsp;iPhone and Android mobile, allowing users to find things to do nearby, and now has brought this same&nbsp;functionality&nbsp;to the web.Explores suggestions are &nbsp;powered by places
    youve been and frequented, the places your friends have visited, the categories and types of places you prefer, what’s popular with other users, the day of the week, places with great tips, the
    time of day and a whole bunch of intelligent criteria.This move by Foursquare shows the power of the checkin and applying your checkins, and your social network’s checkins history toward local
    recommendations, shaping the&nbsp;places&nbsp;you will go in the future.The benefits offered by this type of socially driven local recommendations, creates an powerful new set of incentives for
    mobile users to check-in, one that goes beyond badges and mayor-ship.

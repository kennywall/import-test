Foursquare just&nbsp;took another step with local recommendations&nbsp;by launching a new web version of&nbsp;Foursquare Explore.
Last March during SXSW 2011,&nbsp;Foursquare launched&nbsp;explore for&nbsp;iPhone and Android mobile, allowing users to find things to do nearby, and now has brought this same&nbsp;functionality&nbsp;to the web.
Explore's suggestions are &nbsp;powered by places you've been and frequented, the places your friends have visited, the categories and types of places you prefer, what&rsquo;s popular with other users, the day of the week, places with great tips, the time of day and a whole bunch of intelligent criteria.
This move by Foursquare shows the power of the checkin and applying your checkins, and your social network&rsquo;s checkins history toward local recommendations, shaping the&nbsp;places&nbsp;you will go in the future.
The benefits offered by this type of socially driven local recommendations, creates an powerful new set of incentives for mobile users to check-in, one that goes beyond badges and mayor-ship.
Foursquare Explore shows the local check-in has definitely come of age.

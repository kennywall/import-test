{% include JB/setup %}<p>Linode is a very focused and simple Virtual Private Hosting (VPS) company that delivers some very affordable cloud hosting solutions.
I just stumbled across this company, yet they are a 7 year old "cloud" platform with an pretty impressive set of features out of the box:

	Multiple Linux distributions
	Create Configuration Profiles which associate disk images and device nodes
	Boot between configuration profiles
	Share disk images between configuration profiles
	Resize disk images
	Network and CPU usage graphs
	Multiple IP address support
	Managed/hosted DNS service with slave support
	Custom reverse DNS (rdns)
	Access Out of band console access using Lish
	Lish menu system to issue jobs to your Linode
	Lish access via SSH keys
	Support for booting into single user mode, init=/bin/bash
	Support for booting with a custom "root=" kernel parameter
	Support for booting with an initrd
	Bootable recovery distribution (Finnix)
	Add and remove extra resources to and from your Linode
	Shutdown Watchdog will automatically reboot your Linode in case of a crash
	Clone a Linode to another
	Move IPs from one Linode to another
	IP address fail over support for high availability setups

To make them even more competitive they provide data centers in:

	London, GB, UK
	Newark, NJ, USA
	Atlanta, GA, USA
	Dallas, TX, USA
	Fremont, CA, USA

They look like a pretty scrappy cloud service provider offering computing and storage services. In the Jack of all Clouds, State of the Cloud report they show them as being one of the fastest growing cloud service providers.
With their pricing model, simple dashboard, and straightforward approach, they look like a sensible small business solution for migrating to the cloud.</p>

I&rsquo;m continuing my research into how various cities operate their developer meetups, with a focus on mobile developer gatherings.  Today I&rsquo;m focusing on New York City, a town that is fast becoming a contender with Silicon Valley for developer talent.
I went through the meetups for New York City and found the following mobile developer meetup groups:

Android App Marketing - founded 09/07/2011, with 12 members, and 0 meetups so far
Android Developer Workshop - founded 11/3/2010, with 124 members, and 3 meetups so far
iPhone Developer Training - founded 05/12/2009, with 349 members, and 9 meetups so far
iPhone Game Development NYC - founded 1/23/2010, with 270 members, and 2 meetups so far
Mobile &amp; Emerging Tech NYC - founded 07/25/2012, with 140 members and 1 meetup so far
New York iOS Developer Meetup - founded 04/20/2008, with 3,116 member, ad 44 meetups so far
New York Weekend IPhone Programming Seminar  - founded 09/20/2010, with 196 members, and 10 meetups so far
NY App Meetup - founded 03/24/2010, with 217 members and 5 meetups so far
NYC Mobile App Developers - founded 05/07/2010, with 639 members, and 10 meetups so far 
NYC Mobile Tech Meetup - founded 09/25/2011, with 203 members, and 1 meetup so far
Queens iOS Developers Meetup - founded 06/07/2012, with 73 members, and 2 meetups so far

While New York does not have the volume of members that San Francisco has, it is definitely a close second.  I also notice that NYC has a couple more workshop, learning based meetups--which tells me the community identifies the need for ramping up new mobile developers, which seems crucial.
Beyond that, the patterns seem similar to San Francisco.  I&rsquo;m not sure if this is because it is the model that works, or if NYC is emulating San Francisco.  Only the data will tell.
More to come...

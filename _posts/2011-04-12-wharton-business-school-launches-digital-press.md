{% include JB/setup %}<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/universities/wharton-digital-press.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />The <a title="Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania" href="http://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/">Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania</a> and its online business journal <a title="Knowledge@Wharton" href="http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/">Knowledge@Wharton</a> has launched the <a title="Wharton Digital Press" href="http://wdp.wharton.upenn.edu/">Wharton Digital Press</a>. The school is looking to position itself as an entrpreneurial publisher, by making its business knowledge available in multiple formats from e-books,enhancedbooks, mobile apps and print-on-demand books. The digital press will target its regular business audience, by focusing on management and strategy, innovation and entrepreneurship, finance and investment, leadership, marketing, operations, human resources, social responsibility, business-government relations, and more. <a title="Wharton Digital Press" href="http://wdp.wharton.upenn.edu/">Wharton Digital Press</a> will partner with authors and instead of a traditional advance, they will share the revenue from sales of the books. Interesting approach by a business school to take publishing to the next level by embracing electronic publishing, printing-on-demand and author revenue share models to control content and information on their own networks.

The ability to explain your API to developers and potential consumers is critical to the success of your API Ecosystem. Whether its core API docs, samples, training materials or marketing materials your documentation needs to tell the story of your API and the business problems it solves.
I was just reviewing services offered by SDK Bridge. They had me with the bullets points of their services on their home page:

	API Documentation—both conceptual and reference
	Sample code and tutorials
	Highly technical copywriting
	Training sessions on how to use software platforms
	Technology classes for youth
	We work remotely or on-site with your development team

Then they really drive it home by stating they are the bridge between people and technology. So very true.
Quality documentation and reference material for your Application Programming Interface (API) can be the difference between a developer adopting your API or moving on to another vendor.
I'm adding SDK Bridge to my list of API service providers that can help you deliver a more comprehensive API Ecosystem.

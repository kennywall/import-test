Ok that concludes my Google Cloud Print Proxy work from the week.
I've tried to summarize the work I've done in a series of blog posts and code samples.
Here is a summary of what I've done to date with the Google Cloud Print API:


	Google Cloud PrintIntroduction
	Google Cloud Print Services Interface (API)Introduction
	Authentication with Google Client Login
	Printer Management

	/register


	/list
	/update
	/delete




With this you should be able to create a Google Cloud Print proxy in PHP. Each sample has supporting code samples in the form of Github Gists.
I will publish the entire set of code samples plus a PHP class when done.
I will also publish samples for managing Google Cloud Print jobs using the Google Cloud Print services interface.

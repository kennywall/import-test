{% include JB/setup %}I am always trying to keep an eye on various cloud storage solutions. A company called Cloudberry has been offering an Amazon S3 storage client called CloudBerry Explorer for a while.
Now they are targeting the data backup and restore marketing with their CloudBerry Backup. Current features include:

	Maintain the same data structure on AmazonS3 as you have on your local computer
	Support for Amazon Reduced Redundancy Storage
	Asia Pacific Region support
	Secure Storage
	Data Versioning

Features coming soon are:

	Expose Amazon S3 storage as a local disk on your computer
	Storage costs estimates
	Web interface
	FTP support
	Nirvanix Storage Delivery Network support
	Microsoft Azure Blob Storage support

Interesting to see another player in the cloud backup game. CloudBerry seem to be going down similar road as Jungle Disk with their support of alternate cloud storage providers Nirvanix, and Microsoft Azure Blog Storage. I would still like to see one provider offer a standard cloud storage client for ALL cloud storage providers.

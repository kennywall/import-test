     I am working with several Google APIs this evening. I am pulling my Gmail Messages using Oauth. In the Google Code samples they use Zend Framework. When I had my web development company I made the transition from ASP to PHP I used the Zend framework as a backbone to my platform. So I am familiar. Looking through the libraries I think its definitely time to rediscover the Zend Framework and save myself some time and energy.

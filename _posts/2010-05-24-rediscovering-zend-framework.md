{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am working with several Google APIs this evening. I am pulling my Gmail Messages using Oauth. In the Google Code samples they use Zend Framework.
When I had my web development company I made the transition from ASP to PHP I used the Zend framework as a backbone to my platform. So I am familiar.
Looking through the libraries I think its definitely time to rediscover the Zend Framework and save myself some time and energy.</p>

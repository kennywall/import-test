     Playing around and organizing my Google Contacts under my Google Apps for Your Domain account. Wish they would have collaboration features in here to share with the rest of my co-workers. Seems like I could have more sharing features with other users within the domain to provide a more CRM for your domain feel. I have contact information I would like to share with others, and get some of their contact information. Get to work on it please Google. Thank you.

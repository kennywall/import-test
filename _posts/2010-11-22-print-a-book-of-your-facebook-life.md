{% include JB/setup %}<p>I spend a lot of time thinking about new ways to print as the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Evangelist.During this time I see a common pattern; that print can create more meaningful, physical aspects of our online lives.We create volumes of data through our social streams, online files, emails and other forms data in our daily online lives.Often times the photos and discussions become less valuable because they are so easy to create, so we lose interest in creating organizing photos, emails or other files.This is where I see print being able to be reborn in creating physical, tangible, and more valuable snapshots of our online lives.</p>

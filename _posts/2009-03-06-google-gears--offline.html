Google Gears or the Offline Settings is what had screwed up my Gmail (Google Apps) left hand menu bar.  I just turned offline off for Gmail and my menu went back to normal.

Well that is a big deterrent for me to use the offline settings, for some reason it just made me angry to look at the screen when it was all jacked up.

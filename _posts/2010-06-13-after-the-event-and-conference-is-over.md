{% include JB/setup %}<p>I review how a lot of events are managed to keep an eye out for best practices.One of the most valuable things an event can do is to video tape each one of its sessions.Im sure this can be a fairly costly endeavor, but is money well spent.Google goes the extra mile with their post event wrap up.You can go to the Google I/O sessions page and get for each session:

	Full video of session
	PDF download of session
	Google Wave transcript of session

I just finished watching Matt Cutts, SEO site review session from Google I/O 2010.</p>

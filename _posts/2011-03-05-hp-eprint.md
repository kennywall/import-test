Each HP web connected printers registers itself with the HP ePrint Center, providing a central cloud based area to manage print jobs. ePrint Center also provides other resources like applications, software, and document templates, including: Marketsplash - Professional marketing materials Creative Studio for Home - Home print resources Creative Studio for Business - Business print resources.

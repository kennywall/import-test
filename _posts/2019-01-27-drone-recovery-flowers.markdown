This is my first blog post after putting down API Evangelist, and taking over a month off from technology. It is very overwhelming to reboot my storytelling in a world where I am not the API Evangelist. The persona had become a very critical part of the way I write and tell stories, and I'm unsure where to go next. I figured that I would start with the basics of what makes me happy, working with existing material from my past, until I find my voice again.

I spend a significant amount of time thinking about the time I spent on Drone Recovery a couple years back. One of the things I enjoyed about the trip was the flowers I came across. We started in May, and ended in June, which exposed us to a variety of flowers across the diverse landscape we roamed. I am by no means a flower person, and I do not know what most of the flowers are in these pictures are, but it doesn't stop me from regularly exploring them to trigger memories from that amazing summer.

I fully realize that most of these photos are not "good" photos of flowers, but it doesn't change the fact that each one has a memory attached to them for me. When I look at each one I can recall the place where they were taken, the feeling of the sunshine on my face, and miles I walked to get to that particular place. Experiences that have forever changed my life, and make this summer something I will never ever forget.

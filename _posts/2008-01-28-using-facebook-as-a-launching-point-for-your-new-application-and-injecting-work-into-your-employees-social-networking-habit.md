    Was reading the post on Techcrunch this morning called Huddle uses new apps and Facebook to take on Basecamp.Its interesting on several levels to see another Basecamp competitor as well as
    someone leverage facebook as a marketing tool for their new web applications.How launching a Facebook can be a tool to drive new users to your application.I think it is also very interesting from
    the usage of Facebook and other social networks in the workplace.I mentioned the article in the TimesOnline called Learn to love social network sites about workplace usage of social networks.

     I was reading a good post on getting your API right. They propose following these rules when developing your API: Use HTTP Use Your Verbs Keep Your URL/URIs Consistent Use Your Status Codes Expose (And Accept) Multiple Data Formats Protect Your Users with OAuth Don't Shut Off HTTP Authentication Entirely Document, Document, Document There is a lot more to it, but this is an excellent framework to follow when developing your Application Programming Interface (API).

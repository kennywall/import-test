{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was reading a good post on getting your API right.They propose following these rules when developing your API:

	Use HTTP
	Use Your Verbs
	Keep Your URL/URIs Consistent
	Use Your Status Codes
	Expose (And Accept) Multiple Data Formats
	Protect Your Users with OAuth
	Dont Shut Off HTTP Authentication Entirely
	Document, Document, Document

There is a lot more to it, but this is an excellent framework to follow when developing your Application Programming Interface (API).</p>

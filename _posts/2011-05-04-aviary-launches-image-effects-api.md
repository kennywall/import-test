    Aviary, a creator of web-based image editing tools, launched a new Effects API that can apply filters and utilities to photos via a RESTful interface.What used to be done with server-side
    components like ImageMagick, can now be down through web APIs.The Aviary Effects API provides the following functionality: Auto-Correction - Remove red eye, fix lighting, remove blurriness,
    perfect contrast and color levels Stylistic Filters - Apply retro, polaroid-esque, frames, comic book, with even more in production all the time Utilities - Smart-crop a photo to a persons face,
    rotate a photo, create thumbnails, and resize a batch of photos.The Effects API provides predefined settings that work well with most photos, or you can fine-tune the effect with the built-in
    controls.Since the Effects API has a RESTful interface it works with web and mobile applications.

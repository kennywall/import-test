    I wrote a post last month called, Are QR Codes Relevant Anymore?In a world where everyone has a camera phone, and with image recognition technology like Google Googles, are QR codes a realistic
    way to bridge the physical world with our online lives?I have been a big fan of QR codes for years, and I think other supporters will keep them alive for years to come.But there are a lot of
    really cool technologies emerging, like Moodstocks API.The Moodstocks API is low cost image recognition service, that allows any developer to build in object recognition into their own
    applications.

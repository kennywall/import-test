[<img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/google-cloud-print/google-cloud-print.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />][1]I have been doing a lot of work with [Google Cloud Print][2] lately. It is an amazing platfor, however one complaint I have is that it currently supports printing only through iPhone, IPad and Android devices.

So I started looking and I found a [Google Chrome extension that will let you print documents from your regular desktop or laptop browser][1].

Using the extension, you will see an icon in your address bar when you are vewing a PDF or Word document in a Google Chrome browser.

You can click the icon and print the document using the cloud printers you have registered with your Google Cloud Print service.

I will spend some more time and see if I can find asimilaradd-on for IE or Firefox browsers.

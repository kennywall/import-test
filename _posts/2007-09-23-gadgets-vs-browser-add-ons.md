    While working more and more with my Google Home Page, gadgets and apps I have found that not quite everything I need in my daily operations is available in a gadget or part of the Google
    Application Pool.<br />
    <br />
    This is alright, it will happen.<br />
    <br />
    In the mean time I am working to build an arsenal of Firefox Add-Ons that help me accomplish my goal. So I am starting this blog to help gather my thoughts on this topic.<br />
    <br />
    Maybe some things aren't mean to be a widget...they need to be embedded in the browser?<br />
    <br />
    We will see.

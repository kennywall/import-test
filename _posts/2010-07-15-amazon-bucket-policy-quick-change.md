{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have several Amazon Buckets I quickly want to use for public viewing of images and other files for clients.I havent had time to integrate the bucket policy API into our code base.I just need the buckets updated right away for GETOBJECT for all public users.I logged into the Amazon Console and right clicked on the properties for the bucket.Just ACL functionality here.</p>

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I wanted a way to make the rich content available via&nbsp;CityGrid APIs&nbsp;accessible to anyone, even if you werent a developer.CityGrid has some great&nbsp;iOS and Android software development kits (SDK) available for building local, mobile applications.Ive also built some&nbsp;samples and starter kits for building local web applications in&nbsp;PHP, Python and Ruby.WordPress seemed like the perfect next step to reach a larger audience, so I took the PHP&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal&nbsp;directory that uses&nbsp;CityGrid Places API, and deployed it as a Wordpress Plugin.Now you can launch a quick section on your Wordpress blog or site that allows you to display businesses for your area, in whatever category you wish.</p>

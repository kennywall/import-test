    I was just watching Bill Maher and was listening to their discussion on Kevin Phillips book called Bad Money: Reckless Finance, Failed Politics, and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism, and
    Cornel West said something that summed up how sad things really are:We can see how sad this really is.If we really want to tell the truth in a powerful way.We have corporate greed running a
    muck.We dont have enough jobs with a living wage for fellow citizens.Unavailable health care and child care for millions.

    I have been playing around with some research on cloud computing lately.I am using the Google Platform as a base to store and present all the data.I used Google as a Platform when I was doing my
    social media marketing business.It gave me a ready to go platform to collaborate on without building something from scratch.I am enjoying trying to retrofit it to work as a solid business
    platform, because of this I am looking at it in some very different ways.

    This code sample is something you can find easily on the Internet, but I want to include it in my series about creating a photo book with Flickr.Its easy to pull photos from Flickr, all you need
    is a Flickr API key and the Zend Framework.Notice I use the tags argument to filter my search.In this particular case Im pulling photos that are tagged Instagram App because I want only photos
    Ive taken with Instagram on my IPhone.Next I will be creating a layout for a photo book, using my Instagram photos from Flickr.

{% include JB/setup %}Came across a blog posting for a new social network / platform call Smibs. We ahead and signed up for it. I am always curious how fast these networks will grow.
I monitor my Google rankings pretty thoroughly. Curious to see how fast it rises in the ranks.
Sometimes I will see them popup on my first page pretty quickly. Sometimes I never see them at all.
It is an interesting approach to social networking. I got my basic profile in there, I will play with more later. (maybe)

    I came across the great infographic from ICANN titled, Who Runs the Internet?&nbsp;i want to brush up on my own knowledge about all the key stakeholders in the Internet, so I typed up some of the
    text from the infographic, for my own benefit, as well as to make it a little more interactive.Who Runs The Internet?No One Person, Company, Organization or Government Runs the Internet The
    Internet itself is a globally distributed computer network comprised of many voluntarily interconnected autonomous networks.Similarly, its governance is conducted by a decentralized and
    international multi-stakeholder network of interconnected autonomous groups drawing from civil society, the private sector, governments, academic and research communities, and national and
    international organizations.

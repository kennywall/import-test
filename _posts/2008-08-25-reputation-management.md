{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was Googling my name as I usually do on a Monday morning as part of my personal reputation management.I noticed a social network profile I signed up for a few months back called Naymz has grown significantly in PageRank as well as made it to the first page on my Google Results.So I figured I better work to complete my profile on it and make it as robust and relevant as possible to the conversation(s) I have positioned myself in.Naymz looks like it has become a great social network profile to use in your online reputation management campaign.</p>

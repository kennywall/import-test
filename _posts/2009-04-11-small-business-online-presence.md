{% include JB/setup %}<p>Hitting on a common problem I have, and just need to talk it out a little bit on here so I can continue finding the right approach.My brother Richard has an accounting firm in Hawaii, and my mom and her partner have an alternative health business I guess youd call it.They both do well.However they struggle with their web site and Internet presence.I have offered up to help before, but because I am busy or something else happens I dont deliver.</p>

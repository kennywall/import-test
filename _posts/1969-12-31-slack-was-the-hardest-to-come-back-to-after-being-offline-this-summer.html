<p>I am just getting back to my regular routine after being out in the wilderness, without Internet access for almost ten weeks. I definitely took for granted how much momentum&nbsp;I had built up over the last six years of operating API Evangelist, as it has been quite some work to get all the gears turning again, to make the whole production work as I envision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been working on my monitoring of RSS, Atom, Twitter, and Github streams, as well as the regular syndication of stories I curate, and my own ramblings across the blogs. Unfortunately, I don't have some of the areas up to full speed--like with <a href="http://api.report">API.Report</a>. It is taking a little longer than expected, partly because during this process, I am working hard to identify any friction with the tools I have been using, the processes I employ, and the people I engage with--I want to make things as frictionless as possible going forward.</p>
<p>One notable area of friction has been with Slack. I had joined so many channels, that after coming back it was clear that it&nbsp;was not going to be sustainable. At first, I whittled the channels down to about 15, now I have only 5 Slack channels active, which seems like a pretty manageable amount. Not all Slack channels are created equal, so my comments should be taken lightly (ha, you do this with everything I write huh?)--until I have thought &nbsp;more on this subject.</p>
<p>Slack just feels unsustainable to me at scale. The channels with smart folks, having a thoughtful conversation--not much friction there. The more social channels, which were less about business, and more about being social, and sharing pics, etc--a little more friction. The channels I were in that employed more bots, had more than 50-100 members--lots of friction. I had to turn off these channels, even though some of them still had interesting conversations going on in the cracks.</p>
<p>I just couldn't take the noise and the emotional stream of consciousness from folks. Maybe I'm highly sensitive because I'm just getting back, but it is something I was already experiencing when I left. Maybe I'm sensitive because I'm just a fragile little flower, and I should stop bitching? (possibly) Maybe I need to learn Slack better and be able to filter, and dial things in better. Even so, it is something I will have to make time for, and weigh the ROI on time spent, over the other tools and channels in my world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now Slack is kind of in the same bucket as email for me. It seems to have a lot of people (and bots) who want to dominate your time, and occupy your attention, but I'm guessing that is the point. I am working to be as focused as I can on doing exactly what I need to make API Evangelist operate, then get offline and read, write, and do other more nourishing activities. So far the only way Slack is making the cut in this new world is for me to drastically reduce which channels I'm actually participating in.</p>

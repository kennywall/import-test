Was just checking out a cool service called [doculicious][1]. It allows people to create [HTML forms that generate PDF][1] and email them to you when the form is submitted.

It is a inexpensive and easy way to collect users data and create a legible records of their information. They also provide a few other features:

  * Email submission when forms are submitted
  * Embed the forms in your own web site
  * Export all data collected into popular formats
Overall a pretty cool tool. I would say this web service falls under my category of doing one thing and doing it well.

It is a simple tool that solves a problem well, and provides some added features allowing you to get maximum value.

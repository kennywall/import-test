    The Chromium team talked about improved Google Chrome plug-in security today.Apparently we are seeing more and more security exploits targeting browser plug-ins.Since many plug-ins are
    ubiquitous, they pose the most significant risk to users.To better protect Google Chrome users from the threat of plug-in exploits, Google announced a couple of initiatives: More powerful plug-in
    controls: Google Chrome now has the ability to disable individual plug-ins or to operate in a domain whitelist mode whereby only trusted domains are permitted to load plug-ins.Autoupdate for
    Adobe Flash Player: By including Adobe Flash Player -- the most popular plug-in -- with Google Chrome, browsers can re-use Google Chromes powerful autoupdate strategy and minimize the window of
    risk for patched vulnerabilities.

{% include JB/setup %}I was just listening to an NPR story about how senior Al-Qaida press department has asked supporters to submit questions on a message boards.Supposively they are to be answered by Osama bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri.Many jihadist and terrorists posted questions about he organization and what they should do?Seems everyone is seeing value in social media.

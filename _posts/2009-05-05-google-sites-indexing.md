{% include JB/setup %}<p>I started doing some research on cloud computing a couple weeks ago. I have been watching the Google search results for my name to see how long it took for this research to float up in my profile.
It showed up at #28 now. I have seen other pages too show up below that.
I am interested in seeing how quickly you can launch a site using Google sites and have it indexed. I am using a sub domain off an existing domain. I link to this research from my blog regularly.
In addition to the general cloud computing research, this project is an excercise to see what I can do using the Google Platform as a cloud environment as well.

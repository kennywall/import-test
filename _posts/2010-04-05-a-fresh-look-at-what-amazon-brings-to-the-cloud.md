{% include JB/setup %}One of the reasons I blog is to provide a focus to my research and  learning. I use this research to help me revisit many of the  technologies that I stay in tune with. With many of the top cloud  providers I like to step back and look at what they offer from time to  time to see if I have missed anything or may see things in a different  light.
Take a look at a a current overview of Amazon Web Services.
Compute

	Amazon  Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)  is a  web service that       provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed       to make web-scale computing easier for developers.
	Amazon  Elastic MapReduce - Amazon Elastic MapReduce is a web service that  enables businesses,  researchers, data analysts, and developers to easily and  cost-effectively process vast amounts of data.
	Auto Scaling - Auto Scaling allows you to automatically scale your Amazon EC2  capacity up or down according to conditions you  define.  With Auto Scaling, you can ensure that the number of Amazon EC2  instances you're using scales up seamlessly  during demand spikes to maintain performance, and  scales down  automatically during demand lulls to minimize costs.

Content  Delivery

	Amazon CloudFront - Amazon CloudFront is  a web service for content delivery. It integrates  with other Amazon Web Services to give developers and businesses an easy  way to distribute content to end users with low latency, high data  transfer speeds, and no commitments.

Database

	Amazon  SimpleDB - Amazon SimpleDB is a highly available, scalable, and  flexible  non-relational data store that offloads the work of database  administration.  Developers simply store and query data items via web  services requests, and Amazon SimpleDB does the rest.
	Amazon  Relational Database Service (RDS) - Amazon Relational Database  Service (Amazon RDS)  is a web service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a  relational database in the cloud. It provides cost-efficient and  resizable capacity while managing time-consuming database administration  tasks, freeing you up to focus on your applications and business.

E-Commerce

	Amazon  Fulfillment Web Service (FWS) - Amazon Fulfillment Web Service  (Amazon FWS)  allows merchants to access Amazon.com's world-class fulfillment  capabilities through a simple web services interface. Merchants can  programmatically send order information to Amazon with instructions to  physically fulfill customer orders on their behalf.

Messaging

	Amazon  Simple Queue Service (SQS) - Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)   offers a reliable, highly scalable, hosted queue for storing messages as  they travel between computers. By using Amazon SQS,  developers can simply move data between distributed components of their  applications that perform different tasks, without losing messages or  requiring each component to be always available.

Monitoring

	Amazon  CloudWatch - Amazon CloudWatch is a web service that provides  monitoring for AWS cloud resources, starting with Amazon EC2.  It provides customers with visibility into  resource utilization, operational performance, and overall demand  patterns, including metrics such as CPU  utilization, disk reads and writes, and network traffic.

Networking

	Amazon  Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)  is a  secure and seamless bridge between a company's existing IT  infrastructure and the AWS cloud. Amazon VPC  enables enterprises to connect their existing  infrastructure to a set of isolated AWS  compute resources via a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection, and to  extend their existing management capabilities such as security  services, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems to include their AWS  resources.
	Elastic Load Balancing - Elastic Load  Balancing automatically distributes incoming application  traffic across multiple Amazon EC2 instances.  It enables you to achieve even greater fault tolerance in your  applications, seamlessly providing the amount of load balancing capacity  needed in response to incoming application traffic.

Payments  &amp; Billing

	Amazon Flexible Payments Service (FPS) -  Amazon Flexible Payments ServiceTM (Amazon FPS)  is the first payments service designed from the ground up for  developers. It is built on top of Amazon's reliable and scalable  payments infrastructure and provides developers with a convenient way to  charge Amazon's tens of millions of customers (with their permission,  of course!).
	Amazon DevPay - Amazon DevPay is a  simple-to-use online billing and account management  service that makes it easy for businesses to sell applications that are  built in, or run on top of, Amazon Web Services. It is designed to make  running applications in the cloud and on demand easier for developers.

Storage

	Amazon  Simple Storage Service (S3) - Amazon S3 is storage for the  Internet. It is designed to make web-scale  computing easier for developers.
	Amazon Elastic Block Storage  (EBS) - Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides block level  storage volumes  for use with Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon EBS  volumes are off-instance storage that persists  independently from the life of an instance.
	AWS  Import/Export - AWS Import/Export accelerates moving  large  amounts of data into and out of AWS using  portable storage devices for transport. AWS  transfers your data directly onto and off of storage devices using  Amazon's high-speed internal network and bypassing the Internet.

Support

	AWS  Premium Support - AWS Premium Support is a one-on-one,   fast-response support channel to help you build and run applications on AWS  Infrastructure Services.  It offers technical  assistance from the Amazon Web Services team whenever and as frequently  as your business demands.

Web Traffic

	Alexa  Web Information Service - The Alexa Web Information Service makes  Alexa's vast repository of  information about the traffic and structure of the web available to  developers.
	Alexa Top Sites - The Alexa Top Sites web service  provides access to lists of web sites  ordered by Alexa Traffic Rank. Using the web service developers can  understand traffic rankings from the largest to the smallest sites.

Workforce

	Amazon  Mechanical Turk - Amazon Mechanical Turk is a marketplace for work  that requires human  intelligence. The Mechanical Turk web service enables companies to  programmatically access this marketplace and a diverse, on-demand  workforce. Developers can leverage this service to build human  intelligence directly into their applications.

Amazon was one  of the first movers in the Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)  arena. They have dominated this space and are providing backbone  services to many of the top Software as a Service (SaaS) and even  Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers.
Most of their cloud offerings are available through the Amazon Console,  and all of them through the Application Programming Interface (API) for  full access. Amazon has addressed many of the pain points in developing platforms and software that runs in the clouds. A pretty impressive offering.

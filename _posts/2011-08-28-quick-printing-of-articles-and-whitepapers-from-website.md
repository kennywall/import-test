    "What Do I Wat from te Publisher of the Future?" href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000787">What Do I Want from the Publisher of the Future?</a>" on
    PLoS computational Biology, a<a title="peer-reviewed open access journal" href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/">peer-reviewed open-acccess journal</a>published by the<a title=
    "Public Library of Science" href="http://www.plos.org/">Public Library of Science</a>. After I finished reading it I noticed they had a download as PDF or XML, and it also had an EzReprint link,
    which takes to a page hosted by<a title="Odyssey Press" href="http://www.odysseypress.com/">Odyssey Press</a>, that allows you to print one or more copies of the article in color or black and
    white, and choose a cover. <img src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/mimeo/ezreprint.png" alt="" width="200" align="right" />This is exactly what you can do with<a title=
    "Mimeo Connect" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/">Mimeo Connect</a>. I am working to make it as easy as possible to publish a "print now" button to any site, just by providing the URL of a PDF
    for any document you wish to print. We currently have<a title="print widgets you can deploy on your own site" href="http://developer.mimeo.com/mcp-widgets/index.php">print widgets that you can
    deploy on your own site</a>, using PHP, but we still do not have any plug and play widgets that make printing of articles and whitepapers easy. I am rolling out four new APIs in the coming weeks
    that will make our print now widgets, easier to embed on and website or application.

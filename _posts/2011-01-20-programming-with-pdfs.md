{% include JB/setup %}<p>When it comes to developing for Print applications you need to be able to programmatically manipulate images.Currently with Mimeo, ultimately everything needs to be in a PDF format before it gets sent to the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API.Whether its a report, book, magazine, photo or poster it will have to be PDF document at some point.Hopefully soon we will accept a wider range of formats.:)
I spent some time today looking to see what my options are when it comes to working with PDFs.</p>

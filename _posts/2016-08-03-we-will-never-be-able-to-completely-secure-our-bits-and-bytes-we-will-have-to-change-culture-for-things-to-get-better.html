<p>I am doing a lot of monitoring of security, vulnerability, and cybersecurity reports lately. While doing this it can become easy to slip into despair when you are immersed in this world&nbsp;as you realize how vulnerable we are to attack, and how badly behaved everyone is.</p>
<p>As I see it, we have to work very hard to be sensible and proactive about security, and work to educate individuals, business&nbsp;and government leaders to be savvy when it comes to online security, and privacy--as a community we have a lot of educational and awareness work ahead of us.</p>
<p>Even with all of this, I do not think we are ever going to be able to achieve 100% security over our bits and bytes, and we are going to have to find a way to shift the culture of online behavior to make hacking and the use of many of the cyber weapons we are seeing emerge unacceptable to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure what the specific actions might help us down the higher road--more thoughts to come. I do know though that all of this is not sustainable, and what worries the most is that the US seems to have set the bar for bad behavior pretty high with the activities of NSA, our law enforcement, and the larger tech community.</p>

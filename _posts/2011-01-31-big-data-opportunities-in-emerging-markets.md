As mobile phones and GPS gadgets infiltrate our every day lives, the opportunities for mining of big data grows exponentially.
I was just reading, They are sitting on a gold mine and don't even know it…. from the World Bank Blog.  They are talking about the huge data mining opportunities in analyzing transportation data in emerging markets.
With vehicles being outfitted with GPS, and humans having a GPS system in their pockets the amount of data being generated in real-time is staggering.
When you start cross referencing this data with shopping, housing, food, and other vital data you start seeing huge gaps in infrastructure and commerce.
This amount of data can be overwhelming, but put in the right hands we ca start making sense of some of the most pressing problems in emerging markets, and beyond.

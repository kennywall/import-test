{% include JB/setup %}I have historically played around with many online marketing and social media marketing techniques.  I play around from time to time to see what works and what doesn't.Last year I was walking around with my daughter and taking pictures for our Eugene Local Search web site.  I am trying to have pictures of local attractions and business around Eugene, Oregon.I took this picture of the Eugene Federal Courthouse.  I then told a little story about it and happen to include a link  Eugene Web Design Services which links to our web development company.So it took a relevant geographical picture, some text, then linked with relevant keywords to our web site.I have noticed I still get a some click through on this link as well as some search engine optimization  value.It is a nice example of using Flickr as part of your online marketing and social media marketing strategy.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was browsing the magazine rack at borders books this morning as I often do. I notice an IPhone Application directory magazine. Besides the fact that Mac and I everything seems to dominate the technology section of the magazine rack, Apple really is on it when it comes to publishing.
I would like to see a Blackberry, Android, and other smart phone application directory or overview publication. I think this would be one more step towards the other handheld platforms competing against IPhone.
Just a suggestion guys. Not that I am against IPhone, I am just advocating for the competition and well the phones I posess. I have 2 blackberries and an Android phone.
I will swap out one of my blackberries for an IPhone soon enough.

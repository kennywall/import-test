Been spending more time lately thinking about Facebook Application Development for small businesses.

Was reading Andrew McAfee talking about [The Impact of Information Technology (IT) on Businesses and their Leaders][1] and talking about Facebook AS the Intranet.

Was also talking with another acquaintance about the usage of Facebook as a learning platform for K-12.

I really feel Facebook as a big role to play in the next generation of business and learning. The youth have adopted it and I think it will grow from there.

Has a lot of potential because you can still retain some level of control over your application and leverage the Facebook community to reach your audience.

More to come...

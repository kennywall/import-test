{% include JB/setup %}I was looking for a quick way to get our Social Media Squad blog on the home page and feature area on our new Social Media Squad web site.I wanted it to be a real-time feed, so I chose to go with a JavaScript RSS Feed, and I quickly found Feed2JS.  I was able to select:URL of the RSS FeedNumber of items to displayAmount of RSS description to showShow item posting dateOpen links in a new windowI is nice to just find quality simple tools available out there in cyberspace that you can use to make your life easier...and get work done.

{% include JB/setup %}Really impressed with some of the collaboration features Google is rolling out.I noticed a little arrow on the tabs on my IGoogle Home Page.  Noticed you can now edit and share each tab.  Not sure if this was in there before, but it's cool.So I created a tab with elements that I wanted to share with my wife.  I chose to share and emailed it to her, then logged into her account as I can see the tab and all the widgets on it.Pretty huge piece of collaboration.  You can create project, client or group specific tools and share with only those you wish to.Huge for people who live in their Google Home page and really starts people on a path to having a single social interface to work from.Also noticed when you edit a tab you can choose a layout for it.  Nice for different layout tabs...1...2....3 column layouts.Very nice Google.

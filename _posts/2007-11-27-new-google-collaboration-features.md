{% include JB/setup %}<p>Really impressed with some of the collaboration features Google is rolling out.I noticed a little arrow on the tabs on my IGoogle Home Page.Noticed you can now edit and share each tab.Not sure if this was in there before, but its cool.So I created a tab with elements that I wanted to share with my wife.</p>

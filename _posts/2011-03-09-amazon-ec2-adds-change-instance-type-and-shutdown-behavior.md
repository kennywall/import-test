	Change Instance Type -This means that you can scale up or scale down as your needs change.The new instance type must be compatible with the AMI that you used to boot the instance, so you cant change from 32 bit to 64 bit or vice versa.Shutdown Behavior -You can now control what happens when an EBS-backed instance shuts itself down.You can choose to stop the instance (so that it can be started again later) or to terminate the instance.</p>

    I have been working real hard for the last couple of months to design a solid base for my companies architecture.I was seeing a new theme to my architecture planning, and as a typical geek I have
    to give this some name and / or achronym.So I came up with Ubiquitous Oriented Architecture (UOA).I want one platform for delivering our data using web services to any platform possible.I want to
    deliver event management and marketing tools through whatever channel the user wants without really noticing the difference.

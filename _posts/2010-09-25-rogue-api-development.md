    Application Programming Interfaces (API) are a necessity in todays fast paced business community.An API can encourage mobile application, web application, and desktop development by your most
    passionate users, partners and the public.Even with all this value many businesses dont have time or resources to dedicate to developing, marketing and managing an API.If you are fortunate enough
    to have a passionate user base and / or offer a extremely valuable tool, you may generate the attention of rogue API developers.Recently an innovate hacker Ronnie Roller developed an unofficial
    API for Hacker News.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just finished a recovery of an amazon EC2 instance that failed.It failed not due to anything related to the Amazon EC2 instance.It was something Java related in the ColdFusion environment, and still trying to figure out.Anwyays, as soon as I saw I couldnt recover the services necessary to run the application I quickly deployed a new instance from the AMI I had created of the production isntance a couple weeks ago.Once up I copied all web site files.</p>

{% include JB/setup %}<p>CloudCommons has developed the Service Measurement Index (SMI) Framework, a set of tools for comparing cloud computing service providers.The Service Measurement Index (SMI) Framework uses the following metrics:

	Quality - There are often many different solutions to any IT challenge, and each solution has different quality-of service-attributes, such as defect rates, time to repair, resiliency and scalability.IT needs to be understood in terms of how well it provides quality, in business-relevant and granular terms.Agility - In todays world, new technologies and approaches emerge at a dizzying pace, and IT must become nimble and agile if it is to take advantage of these developments.Agility speaks both to how quickly new capabilities are integrated into the service as needed by the business, and how easily the business can adopt different services or technologies.</p>

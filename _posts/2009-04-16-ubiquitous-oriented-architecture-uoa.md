{% include JB/setup %}<p>A few weeks back I posted a blog entry on my philosophy of a Ubiquitous Oriented Architecture (UOA).It represents my thoughts on developing software with two things in mind:

	Connectivity and dependence on the cloud
	Ubiquitous access that is seamless to the user

When I wrote that early piece on ubiqitous application development I also scribbled this visual.I just got around to translating it using Visio.</p>

A few weeks back I posted a blog entry on my philosophy of a Ubiquitous Oriented Architecture (UOA). It represents my thoughts on developing software with two things in mind:

	Connectivity and dependence on the cloud
	Ubiquitous access that is seamless to the user

When I wrote that early piece on ubiqitous application development I also scribbled this visual. I just got around to translating it using Visio.

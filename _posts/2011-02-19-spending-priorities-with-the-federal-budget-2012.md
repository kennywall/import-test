{% include JB/setup %}<p>Most of the time I feel pretty powerless when it comes to politics in our country.As I see it I have two ways to express myself:

	Voting
	Taxes

Voting always feels like Im forced to pick the lesser of two evils.Very rarely do I ever have positive feelings about any political candidate.Paying taxes always feels like I have to give up 30% of my money to be spent on things that arent important to me.I wouldnt mind paying taxes, as long as it is spent on things I feel are important.</p>

I started getting more traffic to my blog lately and with that came a bunch of SPAM. I dealt with for about a month than I began searching for a solution.

Of course the Wordpress Plugin directory is where to go. I cam across the highly rated [Wordpress WP-SpamFree plugin][1].

I highly recommend it, it took care of my SPAM issues and so far I've only seen a handful of real comments.

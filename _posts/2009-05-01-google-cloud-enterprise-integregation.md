Google continued maturing their cloud offerings for the enterprise world yesterday with a Google Apps LDAP integration tool.
Google Apps Directory Sync now lets businesses and schools with an LDAP user directory system transition more quickly and smoothly to Google Apps. Instead of manually maintaining a separate user account directory in Google Apps, this utility lets Google Apps tap into an existing repository of user account information.
Google's cloud is definitely maturing and making major leaps forward to allow for enterprise adoption of the Google Cloud. I have talked about the Google Secure Data Connector, Google Data Visualization, and the overall approach Google seems to be making in regards to a complete cloud platform in IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS areas.
I enjoy seeing more of the pieces coming together for the Google Cloud Platform.

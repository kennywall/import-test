    Im always on the lookout for tools that CityGrid publishers can use alongside the web and mobile apps theyve built using CityGrid Places and Advertising APIs.Today I came across a cool Wordpress
    plugin&nbsp;over at&nbsp;WP Mayor, a site for&nbsp;WordPress news, articles, hacks and plugin reviews, that&nbsp;turns your local blog into an iPhone enabled city guide,&nbsp;called Placeling.To
    get started,&nbsp;Placeling&nbsp;provides an iPhone app that allows you to mark places that youve been, which will provide the reference for blog posts that you write later.&nbsp;Next you install
    and activate the&nbsp;Placeling plugin&nbsp;in your Worpress site.Youll notice that now, when you write a blog post youll see a marketer next to the upload photo button, and a new box called
    Placeling below the main editor.

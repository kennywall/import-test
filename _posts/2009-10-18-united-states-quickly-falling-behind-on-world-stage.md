    The United States is going to continue falling behind on the world stage as we prioritize spending our money on wars, wall street bailouts and other unnecessary things that do not help us grow as
    a society.Finland recently made access to Broadband Internet a legal right.Also Uruguay has become the first country to provide a laptop for every child attending state primary school.These
    countries obviously see their future on the world stage is dependent on their investment in education and technology.Getting kids access to computers and Internet from early on will give them a
    head start in life!

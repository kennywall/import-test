{% include JB/setup %}I am stilling sifting through all the blogs I read and information I gather on a clear definition in my mind of what describes all the content I generate around the Internet.My social graph is a definition of my relationships and my communication with these people.I have been reading more on the social media index and how you can rate someone using this methodology based upon several key areas:BlogsMulti-FormatMini-UpdatesBusiness CardsVisualFavouritesFlexible weightingHowever this addresses highly public organizations or people with distinct presence.  I have a blog / site that I maintain, but I am no means Techcrunch.What sort of definition describes me and the content I publish all over the place at:Social NetworksVideo Sharing SitesImage &amp; Picture Sharing SitesSocial Bookmarking SitesAnd much moreWhat single definition describes my user generated content distributed all over the Internet?Once I can define I can continue to define a metric and ultimately a measurement of this presence.

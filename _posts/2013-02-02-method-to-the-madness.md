    Im always working to find a way to organize my world, to help me better keep track of my wealth of content and information, while also assisting people in navigating my sometimes chaotic world of
    sites, blogs and projects.To help organize this, Im breaking my navigation on KinLane.com into two main groups.&nbsp;The first area is overview information about my world in the following
    sections: Blog&nbsp;- My personal thoughts and random observations in blog form About&nbsp;- My official bio that I use across most of my profile, which changes each year Research&nbsp;- Any
    areas Im currently researching or looking to research in the near future Projects&nbsp;- Projects that Ive completed and made publicly available (hopefully on Github) Talks&nbsp;- Some video and
    slideshows from talks that Ive given Images&nbsp;- A variety of logos, photos and drawings from across my world as API Evangelist Mission&nbsp;- The mission statement for my evangelism platform
    Contact&nbsp;- Various ways you can get a hold of me The second area is providing links to all my main properties: API Evangelist&nbsp;- Business of APIs API Voice&nbsp;- Politics of APIs API
    Stack&nbsp;- My ranking system for the API space Hack Weekends&nbsp;- A resource site focused on hackathons IPA Evangelist&nbsp;- My personal blogging about my love of IPAs Hacker
    Storytelling&nbsp;- A format Im using in 2013 to make my projects open and machine readable by default When you google my name, KinLane.com comes up first.

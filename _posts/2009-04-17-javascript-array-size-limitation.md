{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just working on an EXTJS datarid and it wouldn't appear in Chrome no matter what I did.  

Then I removed a bunch of rows and it worked.  I thought it was special characters in the data.

Then I figured out exactly how many rows I could, but when I put all my columns back in it stopped.

So I figured that an overall array has a limitation in Chrome.

Haven't researched this at all...just recording here so I will.</p>

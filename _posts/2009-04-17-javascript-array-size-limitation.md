    I was just working on an EXTJS datarid and it wouldn't appear in Chrome no matter what I did. Then I removed a bunch of rows and it worked. I thought it was special characters in the data. Then I
    figured out exactly how many rows I could, but when I put all my columns back in it stopped. So I figured that an overall array has a limitation in Chrome. Haven't researched this at all...just
    recording here so I will.

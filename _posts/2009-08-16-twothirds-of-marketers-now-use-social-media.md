    I am just gonna paste this article I came across on Mashable, called Two-Thirds of Marketers Now Use Social Media because it says it all: Earlier this year, we reported that 63 percent of
    companies planned to increase their spending on social media in 2009.Thus, its not too surprising that a recent study from the Association of National Advertisers reveal that 66 percent of
    marketers have now used social media in some capacity in 2009.Also not surprising, the top platforms being utilized: Facebook (74%), YouTube (65%), Twitter (63%), LinkedIn (60%).Combined, this
    usage represents significant growth from 2007, when the same survey indicated that just 20 percent of marketers were using social media.Although social media marketing is clearly on the rise, it
    remains a relatively small part of most marketing budgets.

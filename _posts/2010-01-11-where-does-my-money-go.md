     I found a much more colorful visual of where government spending goes. It is in the UK, but still very cool. They did a much better job visually displaying the data then I did on my Oregon or California State Budgets. Where Does My Money Go? Pretty cool visualizations of Government spending. I predict much more to come in 2010.

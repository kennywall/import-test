{% include JB/setup %}<p>Google Feed Server is an open source Atom Publishing Protocol server based on the Apache Abdera framework. Google Feed Server provides a simple back end for data adapters, which allows developers to quickly deploy a feed for an existing data source such as a database.
Google Feed Server also provides the Feed Server Client Tool (FSCT), which lets developers perform create, receive, update, and delete (CRUD) operations on a Feed Server feed.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I came across a great walk through of how to deploy your code from GitHub automatically.Having managed a large number of web applications derived from various code repositories, I see the value in this.I used to write some pretty complex scripts to do this automatically with SVN across 20+ Amazon EC2 instances.You can configure your EC2 AMIs to automatically update upon new instances launch.Great way to load-balance code.</p>

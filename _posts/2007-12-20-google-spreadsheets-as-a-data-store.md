    I just finished BETA testing the DocSyncer tool which will keep mycomputer synced with my Google Docs account.At first I had settings turned on to upload.html pages, which was a huge
    mistake.instantly it started publishing thousands of files of my local workstation, be careful.Once I did get my 800+ word and excel documents published synced up without any effort I started
    looking through them and searching on topics.

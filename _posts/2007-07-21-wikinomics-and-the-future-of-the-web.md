    Need to share my thoughts on an amazing book that has really changed and accelerated the way I think about the web.After I read this book I literally was high from what it exposed me to, after I
    was done it has taken me weeks to absorb what was told.I recommend everyone to read this book and let it change the way youll see the future of the Internet.Here is an excerpt from the books
    site:Today, encyclopedias, jetliners, operating systems, mutual funds, and many other items are being created by teams numbering in the thousands or even millions.While some leaders fear the
    heaving growth of these massive online communities, Wikinomics proves this fear is folly.

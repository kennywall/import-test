The end of the year is a great time for reflection. 2012 was kind of a blur, and with the amount of API Evangelism I did, I had little time to reflect on where I went and the places I enjoyed.

I wanted a quick way to create some kind of visualization, showing where i had been over the year.  Foursquare was the first placed I looked and using [Singly][1] I was quickly able to pull my year of checkins.

This is just one question I want to ask of my online digital world.  There are [so many other questions I have about my personal data][2], and will be working to deliver answers to them when I can.

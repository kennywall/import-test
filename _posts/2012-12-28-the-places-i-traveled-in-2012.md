The end of the year is a great time for reflection. 2012 was kind of a blur, and with the amount of API Evangelism I did, I had little time to reflect on where I went and the places I enjoyed.
I wanted a quick way to create some kind of visualization, showing where i had been over the year. &nbsp;Foursquare was the first placed I looked and using Singly I was quickly able to pull my year of checkins.




This is just one question I want to ask of my online digital world. &nbsp;There are so many other questions I have about my personal data, and will be working to deliver answers to them when I can. &nbsp;

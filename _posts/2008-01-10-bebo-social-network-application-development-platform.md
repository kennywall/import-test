{% include JB/setup %}<p>I went ahead and signed up for Bebo Social Network tonight.I was reading a blog post on Techcrunch called Bebos Platform Now Open for All Developers and thought I should go ahead check it out for myself.I belong to most of the major Social Networks now and was reading the other day on how Bebo was named as best social networking site in a survey and is beating out FacebookIt is a very clean application similar to Facebook.Which I like.That is one thing about MySpace that really bothers me is how it is so cluttered and just crappy looking.</p>

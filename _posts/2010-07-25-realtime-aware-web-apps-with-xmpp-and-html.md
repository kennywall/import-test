{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am spending time each week learning something new about HTML5 and brainstorming ways it can be applied in my every day business world.Here are two areas I am researching:

	Using HTML 5 Web SQL Database and HTML5 Web Storage to make web applications run more efficiently by running them locally.Using HTML 5 Web Sockets and HTML 5 Server-Sent Events to allow my web applications to be real-time and aware as Internet is available.I also just finished reading How to Create an XMPP-Driven Application in JavaScript.Using HTML 5 Web Sockets you can interface with any XMPP server and create a full-duplex communications channel within the web browser.</p>

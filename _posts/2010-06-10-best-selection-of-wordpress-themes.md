{% include JB/setup %}<img class="c1" title="Wordpress" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/wordpress.jpg" alt="" width="282" height="180" align="right" />I've set up quite a few <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> blogs in my day. I've spent hours and hours looking for a theme for various <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?cat=186">Wordpress</a> installations. In some recent searching I came across a new site of <a href="http://www.wpexplorer.com/">FREE and Premium Wordpress Themes</a>. <a href="http://www.wpexplorer.com/">WPExplorer</a> has the cleanest and most functional <a href="../?cat=186">Wordpress</a> themes I've seen. They seem to be owned by or work with <a href="http://templatic.com/">Templatic</a>.

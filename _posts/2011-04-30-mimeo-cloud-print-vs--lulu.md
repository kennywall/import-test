<p>
     <span id="internal-source-marker_0.2542797683272511"><a title="Mimeo.com" href="Mimeo.com">Mimeo.com</a> vs. <a title="Lulu.com" href="http://www.lulu.com/">Lulu.com</a> I wanted to help people understand the difference.
</p>

<p>
     Lulu.com lets you make, self-publish, print and sell print-on-demand books, e-books, photo books and calendars.
</p>

<p>
     <a href="http://developer.mimeo.com">Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Platform</a> lets you build Lulu's.
</p>

<p>
     This means you can build self-publishing web sites and applications that leverage the printing power of Mimeo.com

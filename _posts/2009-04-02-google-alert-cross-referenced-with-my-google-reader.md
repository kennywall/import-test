{% include JB/setup %}<p>Hey Google! Can you guys please cross reference my Google Alert for blog searches with my Google Reader.
I do not need to get alerts for items I already have in my Google Reader.
Just a thought! Thanks so much for adding this new Google Alert and Google Reader feature.</p>

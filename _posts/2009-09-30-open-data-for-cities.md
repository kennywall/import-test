    I was just reading ReadWriteWebs post on City of Portland, Oregon Officially Backs Open, Structured Data.As a data professional and politically minded individual I feel this is a huge
    step.Especially since it is in my home state.I firmly believe that transparency and sharing of data by city, state and federal government is true democracy.It puts the data into the hands of
    citizens who can crunch, repurpose, and mashup the data showing summaries and patterns that the government may not be able to see.

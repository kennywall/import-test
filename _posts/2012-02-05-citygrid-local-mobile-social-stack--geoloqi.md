{% include JB/setup %}<p>In February I&rsquo;m spending more time building, what I&rsquo;ve dubbed the CityGrid Local, Mobile, Social Stack, a list of APIs, platforms and tools that you can use in your local-mobile applications.Of course CityGrid&nbsp;Places,&nbsp;Offers,&nbsp;Reviews&nbsp;and&nbsp;Advertising&nbsp;are first in that stack, but I want to identify other APIs, tools and platforms that can also assist you in quickly building your mobile app.As I add items to this stack.I will showcase them one by one here on the blog.The first one on my list is&nbsp;Geoloqi, which offers a pretty impressive set of location tracking, message and geofencing APIs and SDKS:

Real-time Location Tracking -&nbsp;Low battery impact, easy to setup mobile location tracking system, built for multiple platforms.</p>

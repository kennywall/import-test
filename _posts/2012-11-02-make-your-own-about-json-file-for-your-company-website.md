     I spend a lot of time trying to find company logos and a little blurb about what a company does.  You'd think in this cloudy API driven world there would a simpler way.  
</p>
<p>
     I decided to create my own solution.  I created an <a href="http://www.apievangelist.com/about.json" target="_blank">about.json file for API Evangelist</a>.
</p>
<p>
     When you need my company logo, a quick description about API Evangelist or other key information like my Twitter account or Blog RSS, you know where to find it.
</p>
<p>
     Now, could you please create one for your company?  You can copy my about.json above, go to <a href="http://jsoneditoronline.org/">JSON Editor Online</a>, paste it in and create your own.  When done, make sure and save to your desktop as text file and upload to the root of your site.  
</p>
<p>
     I'll always take a look at http://example.com/about.json first to see if a company has it, before Googling on my own for a logo and about blurb.
</p>
<p>
     Maybe some day, every site will have one.

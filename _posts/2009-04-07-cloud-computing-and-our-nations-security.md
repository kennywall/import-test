     As we are all jumping on the Cloud Computing bandwagon we are considering the security implications of our decision to move our entire companies operations into the cloud. Where exactly is my data center stored? Where are the cloud data centers? What happens when the big cloud providers like IBM, Amazon, Microsoft, and Sun start gobbling up all the smaller providers. All the nations data will become increasing more consolidated and easily targeted for attack. I just finished reading a great post that provides a look into the future regarding the vulnerability of our economy and data. What could be the next major hit our economy and society takes. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shelly-palmer/metamerica-evolving-the-g_b_183542.html#postComment">Metamerica: Evolving The Governance Of A Digital Democracy</a> It is an interesting look into the future and the problem we face.

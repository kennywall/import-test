After spending some time  last weekend reviewing the exhibitors at the upcoming OSCON - Open  Source Convention I noticed a pattern:
There  is an explosion in database innovation right now
I listed seven separate database platforms and tools that are  exhibiting at the Open Source Convention. In addition to not listing Schooner Information Technology, I left out the elastic data solution provider:
Northscale
They provide a couple key tools to assist you in managing your elastic data:

	NorthScale Membase Server
	NorthScale Memcached Server

Their products are based upon the memcached and membase open source technologies. Their servers are designed to work with existing relational database technology and expertise, and incrementally evolve toward a scale-out data architecture for use by web applications.
They provide a developer kit to get you going.

     I have been going round and round with Amazon Web Services EC2 and Trend Micro MAPS for about 2 weeks now about the entire Amazon IP address block being black listed. Finally got some action out of Amazon. They are going to add <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=1095">PTR records for all of the Amazon EC2 IP addresses</a> that we lease. Great news for legitimizing my usage of Amazon Web Services EC2 for our email infrastructure. <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/?p=1095">I'll write more about this later.</a>

{% include JB/setup %}<p>During my monitoring for the API stack this last week, I noticed that both Parse and New Relic had launched mobile analytics platforms.I&rsquo;ve been tracking on various API driven analytics platforms, and after seeing both Parse and New Relic launch their offerings, I thought, who else is doing this?Here are a few of the analytics platforms that launched in the last 30 days:

02/21/2013 - TEOCO Launches INrange&trade; Location-Based Predictive Analytics Solution

    The whole point of deploying a Google Cloud Print Proxy is to be able to manage print jobs.After authenticating using Google ClientLogin API, you can then fetch an existing Google Cloud Print Job
    from the users queue.Each print job has an ID that you can use to reference the print job and control the status with /control service.The Google Cloud Print /control endpoint accepts the
    following parameter(s): jobid - Unique job identification (generated by server).status - Status of the job, which can be one of the following: QUEUED: Job just added and has not yet been
    downloaded.

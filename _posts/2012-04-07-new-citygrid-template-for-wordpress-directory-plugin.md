{% include JB/setup %}I just pushed an update for the&nbsp;CityGrid Wordpress Directory Plugin. The Wordpress Plugin lets any Wordpress site owner to launch a business directory for their site, allowing them to choose the business categories they wish to display.
For example, if you want to show pizza, burgers, seafood and chinese food in your neighborhood you can launch the plugin, choose your categories, enter your city, neighborhood or zip code and it automatically adds a directory to your menu with the categories you wish to display.
The plugin has been around for a month, but it had a pretty basic look and feel, I wanted it to look better. Last week took the HTML and CSS template for&nbsp;CityGrid, cleaned it up and turned it into a&nbsp;template for any developer to use when deploying a local web directory.
I want my Wordpress users to take advantage of this, so this week I added it to the&nbsp;CityGrid Wordpress Directory Plugin. While doing this I also added a framework, allowing users to choose from multiple templates, meaning I will be adding more UI templates in the future.
I am almost done, adding the same template to the&nbsp;CityGrid Wordpress Local Search Plugin&nbsp;today and committing the changes for everyone to take advantage of.

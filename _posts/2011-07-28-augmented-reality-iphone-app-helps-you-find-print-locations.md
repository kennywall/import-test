     Print is an important part of our hectic business world, and when we are preparing for an important meeting or that up-coming training session, we often find ourselves needing to print from unplanned locations. Every mobile worker in today's today's fast paced world has been there. To address the needs of the mobile workforce, WorkSnug has partnered with HP's ePrint� to make a third-party mobile app to help you navigate a global network of publicly available printers. HP ePrint� has more than 9,000 printers installed in public spaces all around the world, in places like hotel lobbies, FedEx retail locations, Starbucks and other print service providers. WorkSnug's is an augmented reality iPhone application that locates print locations and directs users to those locations, to print their mission critical documents. Users can hold up their iPhone, and see HP ePrint� locations in augmented reality and map display view. WorkSnug is a tool that connects mobile workers to the nearest and best places to work. WorkSnug's has visited and reviewed thousands of viable workspaces, and evaluated WiFi, noise levels, power provision, community feel, even the quality of the coffee, in cafes, coworking spaces, hotel lounges and other mobile working locations, all across the world. "WorkSnug already provides a unique, user-generated database of the very best touch-down working locations around the world and we know our users will love the ability to find nearby printers. We see ourselves as the Swiss Army Knife for mobile workers, and we just acquired a superbly useful new blade!", says Richard Leyland, of WorkSnug. iPhone users can download WorkSnug Pro for free from the iTunes App Store.

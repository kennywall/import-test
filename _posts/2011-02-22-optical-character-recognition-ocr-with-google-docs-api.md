{% include JB/setup %}<p>Using the Google Docs List API you can convert high-resolution PDFs or images into editable text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).Google Docs List API can extract the text from the following document formats:

	PDF Document (application/pdf)
	JPG Image (image/jpeg)
	PNG Image (image/png)
	GIF Image (image/gif)

OCR is an experimental API feature and has a quota in place, limiting the number of calls that can be made.API quota is higher for Google Apps for Business users.OCR is available through the API by including the ocr=true parameter when uploading a file, then produces a separate Google Docs with extracted text for each uploaded PDF or Image.</p>

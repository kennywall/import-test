     <img class="alignnone c1" title="State of the Cloud" src="http://www.jackofallclouds.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/cloud_providers_snapshot.png" alt="" width="250" align="right" />I was just reading <a href="http://www.jackofallclouds.com/2010/07/state-of-the-cloud-july-2010/" target="_blank">State of the Cloud</a> over at <a href="http://www.jackofallclouds.com/2010/07/state-of-the-cloud-july-2010/" target="_blank">Jack of all Clouds</a>. They monitor the various players in the cloud game and who the movers and shakers are. They state the known about the cloud industry. <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/category/amazon/" target="_self">Amazon</a> and Rackspace are the lead players. What I like is that they introduced me to <a href="http://www.linode.com" target="_blank">Linode</a>. I haven't come across these guys yet. I'm reviewing their offerings now and more to come. I am the biggest Amazon evangelist and use cloud platform heavily. As much as I love Google, Amazon and my IPhone, they all are reminders to me of the day in 1999 where I loved Microsoft the same way. I was a regular drinker the kool-aid. Since then I've recovered, and when it comes to cloud computing I think diversity is good. I root for the little guy and hope they can deliver a set of tools that can compete with the big boys. Good luck <a href="http://www.linode.com/" target="_blank">Linode</a>.

    I was working on the review of my small business IT infrastructure today, which includes our servers at Amazon EC2.As I was looking at my server role definitions and the corresponding Amazon EC2
    Security Groups I saw a new blog post come in from Amazon Web Services.They put together an overview of building three-tier architectures with security groups.I learned a few things while reading
    which will hopefully help be better setup my infrastructure: You can reference other security groups instead of IP addresses when adding entries Creating security for external users such as
    vendors or development groups Security groups filters traffic internally and externally.So this was an eye opener about truly securing your three-tier architecture.

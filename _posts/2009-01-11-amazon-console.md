     I've been using the new Amazon Web Service (AWS) console. It is a pretty sweet little interface. AWS Console allows me to easily manage my Amazon EC2 instances and related elements. I normally (and still) use the ElasticFox Mozilla Add-On to manage my Amazon EC2 Instances. I recommend checking it out at: <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com">https://console.aws.amazon.com</a>

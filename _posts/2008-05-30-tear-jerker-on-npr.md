     Those of you know me, know that I'm an NPR junkie....I love the stories and music. I listen to the StoryCorp programs every week. Many touching stories.
     <br />
     <br />
     There was one today that really moved me:
     <br />
     <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90959458"><br />
     http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=90959458</a>
     <br />
     <br />
     It was a mom telling the story about how her 9 year old son died watching a sunset.
     <br />
     <br />
     WOW. That was moving.

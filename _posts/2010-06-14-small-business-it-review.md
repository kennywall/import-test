{% include JB/setup %}I got really busy over April and May and neglected a some of my infrastructure.  I'm doing a thorough review / audit of all my Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure.
In this era of Cloud Computing my review does not stop at workstations, servers and printers.  All services provided by 3rd party providers are included in my IT plan.
I'm a little ahead of the curve because I feel confident in using the cloud more than other IT managers.  So a larger portion of my IT infrastructure exists in the cloud.
I treat them all the same.  No matter where my infrastructure lies, my goal is to review, document and make sure it meets my business needs.
I use a Wiki to track my IT infrastructure, after I go through and do my review I will publish a short list of the different areas of my "cloud" IT Infrastructure.

    I got really busy over April and May and neglected a some of my infrastructure. I'm doing a thorough review / audit of all my Information Technology (IT) Infrastructure.<img class="alignnone"
    style="padding: 15px;" title="IT Management" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/information-technology/ITmanagement2.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> In this era of Cloud
    Computing my review does not stop at workstations, servers and printers. All services provided by 3rd party providers are included in my IT plan. I'm a little ahead of the curve because I feel
    confident in using the cloud more than other IT managers. So a larger portion of my IT infrastructure exists in the cloud. I treat them all the same. No matter where my infrastructure lies, my
    goal is to review, document and make sure it meets my business needs. I use a Wiki to track my IT infrastructure, after I go through and do my review I will publish a short list of the different
    areas of my "cloud" IT Infrastructure.

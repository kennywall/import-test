    <a title="human designer or creator" href="http://www.kinlane.com/2011/05/3d-printing-the-creators/">human designer or creator.</a> There are wide variety of 3D scanners that can be used in the
    3D printing process. A 3D scanner is a device that analyzes a real-world object to collect data on its shape and possibly its appearance. The resulting data can then be used to construct 3D
    models. 3D scanning is no replacement for a human designer, but can offer a good start creating a 3D representation. Each 3D scanner has its benefits and limitations, and resulting data will
    always need much work before it can be used in 3D printing. 3D scanners can offer a lot of benefit in rapid prototyping, and reverse engineering of existing objects. Just like 3D printers you
    will find a wide range of 3D scanners, in both functionality and price. You can also find innovative hobbyists employing tools like the Xbox Kinect for generating 3D scans. 3D Scanners are just

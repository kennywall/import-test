     On my hunt for killer scripts and tools to go with with my Cloud Print API, I came across a way cool JQuery Flipbook script over at codecanyon. Flipbook jQuery provides a magazine / book style display for digital media. The features include: JQuery Powered Works with images, videos, audio and text Includes ZoomVideoPlayer Lightbox support It also allows you to customize the width / height of the gallery. I'm going to be bundling it with cloud printing bundle for previewing and interacting with print documents before sending off to be physically printed. I don't think digital media delivered in a Flipbook format is a replacement for books or magazines, but is a great way to preview or browse content before physically committing to having it printed.

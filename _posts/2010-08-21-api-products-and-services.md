I'm seeing a lot of chatter on the Internets lately about API development and best practices. Like 10 Common Mistakes Made by API Providers at RWW and APIs: an Important Part of Product Strategy at ProgrammableWeb.
I had the pleasure of sitting with the engineer from Mashery a couple weeks ago and listen to their assessment of the API market. Ever since then I've been reviewing their approach to API deployment and working to understand the playing field better.
Today I came across Sonoa and the free API tools at Apigee. Apigee offers:

	API Testing
	API Debugging
	API Analytics
	API Protection

I'm checking out Sonoa and what they offer more. I am also adding testing, debugging, and protection to my list of API building blocks.

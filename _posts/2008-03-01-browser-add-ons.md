{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am pretty addicted to to Firefox Browser Add-Ons.I have many of them to the point of add-on overload.I use them for adding items to my Google Notebook, Amazon S3, CoComment, and much more.I syndicate and share to many social networks, social bookmarking, and other sharing sites.I do all this through Firefox.</p>

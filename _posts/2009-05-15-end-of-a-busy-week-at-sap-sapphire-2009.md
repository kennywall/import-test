{% include JB/setup %}Finished up a very busy week yesterday at the SAP SAPPHIRE 2009 conference in Orlando, FL. Haven't had much time on my hands to do any blogging or much of anything beyond just managing registration at SAPPHIRE. The show was a success. I feel good about it. It was my first on-site with the company and it is our largest event of the year. We had several technology successes including Airport Registration at the Orlando Airport and Self Check-In Kiosks. Both were a huge success. There was a lot more to come out of the conference, but I am still a little too tired to remember it all. I will blog more later. Also I am postponing my trip to Washington DC to get caught up on some work and prepare for the Google IO conference in 2 weeks.

    I have been getting asked by friends for information on how to setup their own business.I think in these hard times getting a business going can be a very appealing alternative to finding another
    job.While I was doing the research I figured Id just publish here for everyone to reference.This generally applies to starting a business in Oregon, because that is where I am located.First go to
    the State of Oregon and fill out the Assumed Business Name (ABN) new registration form.

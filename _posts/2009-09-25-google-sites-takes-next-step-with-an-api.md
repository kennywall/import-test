{% include JB/setup %}<p>Google recently opened up Google Site and introduced an API as well as import / export features for Google Sites. I think this will increase the potential for enterprise and other business adoption.
You can now get your data out of Google Sites easily, which is key to adoption.
You can also quickly build , replicate and evolve your Google Site programmatically using the new API. This will make it easier to integrate with internal and other 3rd party content management systems. Definitely will grow the use and adoption of Google Sites as a site or content management system.
I use Google Sites pretty heavily for various departmental efforts at companies I work for including technical project management and product management.
Thanks Google!</p>

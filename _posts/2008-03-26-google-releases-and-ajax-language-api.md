    Google added another interesting piece to its API stack. Now with the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxlanguage/">Google AJAX Language API</a>, you can translate and detect the language
    of blocks of text within a webpage using only Javascript. The language API is designed to be used to translate and detect languages on the fly when off line translations are not available.<br />
    It is a nice addition to the Google Family of API's and great for internationalization of web applications.<br />

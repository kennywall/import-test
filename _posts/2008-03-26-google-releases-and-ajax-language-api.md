Google added another interesting piece to its API stack. Now with the [Google AJAX Language API][1], you can translate and detect the language of blocks of text within a webpage using only Javascript. The language API is designed to be used to translate and detect languages on the fly when off line translations are not available.
It is a nice addition to the Google Family of API's and great for internationalization of web applications.

    I know I've ranted about this before, but here we go again. It cannot be said enough. EVERY business that has a web site and has information on the Internet needs to provide RSS Feeds for that
    data.<br />
    <br />
    I am looking for product review web sites right now. Looking to harvest data on different product areas and feed it back out to users. I am not looking to harness the traffic, it will go to the
    source of the reviews. I do this to get data and statistics and ultimately provide value to end-users.<br />
    <br />
    4 out of 5 sites I come across have reviews but do not have an RSS Feed. I understand that some people are worried about their proprietary data, well.....get over it. RSS will generate new users
    and syndicate your content beyond your web site.<br />
    <br />
    If you can't figure out how to have an RSS feed, go get a Wordpress blog and start using that!!

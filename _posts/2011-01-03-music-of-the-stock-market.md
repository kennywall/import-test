    I am intrigued of any patterns or art you can extract from Big Data.I have been fascinated by the art of fractal mathematics since my 7th grade social studies teacher introduced me to them in
    1984.Her boyfriend was an early pioneer in this field.I was playing with the DOW piano, which takes the ups and downs of 2010s market into musical notes.Using a five-note scale spanning three
    octaves, pitch is determined by each days closing level.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I monitor my reputation basically on a daily basis as part of my routine.I Google myself and see how things are stacked and if there is anything new.I have a pretty unique name so I pretty much dominate all the listings.Today a new profile site showed up on my first page called Disqus.Just pretty much a social network profile and it aggregates comments from me around the Internet.</p>

I monitor my reputation basically on a daily basis as part of my routine.  I Google myself and see how things are stacked and if there is anything new. I have a pretty unique name so I pretty much dominate all the listings.Today a new profile site showed up on my first page called Disqus.  Just pretty much a social network profile and it aggregates comments from me around the Internet.Will evaluate the tool more later. Not sure if it was a conscious effort on their part or it just happened, but it occurred to me that you could target prominent Internet users in this way, but publishing a page or starter profile for them and show up in their rankings and spike their interest a little more.  Enough to maybe get them to signup?This page on Disqus had a big "Claim this Profile" button that lured me in, I am a sucker for social networks and big sign me up buttons.

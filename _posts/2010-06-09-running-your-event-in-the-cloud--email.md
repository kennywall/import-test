{% include JB/setup %}<p>Email is still the number one tool for managing events and communicating  with attendees, speakers, and exhibitors.Social network is definitely  the future of the event communication, but until then email rules.Sending  out call for papers, speaker, exhibitor, attendee invitations and other  emails around a conference can require a well oiled email  infrastructure to make sure emails get into the inbox.I see  events send anywhere from a few hundred to several million emails over  the life span of an event.Sending emails in the cloud can work well  whether your sending a small amount using Google Apps or millions using  Amazon Web Services.</p>

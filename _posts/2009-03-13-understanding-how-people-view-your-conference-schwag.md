    I am spending time evaluating and understanding the social footprint of conferences and events.One event I am monitoring right now is the SXSW 2009 event.It is a great candidate because there is
    a alot of online and social activity around this show.I came across a blog post by Download Squad called unbagging of the Schwag.It really shows how your schwag and materials will get viewed or
    NOT viewed.

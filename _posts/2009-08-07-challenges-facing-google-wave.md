{% include JB/setup %}When it comes to Google Wave, it can be tough to find truly new perspectives on how it works and its potential usage and adoption. I just finished reading a great post by <a href="http://dashes.com">Anil Dash</a> called <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2009/08/what-works-the-web-way-vs-the-wave-way.html">What Works: The Web Way vs. The Wave Way</a>. He provides a perspective and analysis of Google Wave that left me thinking rather than just feeling I read recycled thoughts on Google Wave. There is a lot of challenges ahead of Google Wave before it achieves the "web changing" status everyone has given it. He lays this out very well. Thanks Anil.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>One of the most common types of integrations Ive been doing lately are single sign on (SSO) integrations with print marketplaces.On this blog, most of the time I talk about REST API integration with Mimeo, so I wanted to spend some time talking about Mimeo Marketplace integration.A Mimeo Marketplace lets you create your own customized online storefront, publish documents, and let others do the ordering.reducing the time, expense, and resources of pre-printing, storing, and distributing publications yourself.Mimeo prints the documents on-demand and ships them where and when they are needed, even overnight!</p>

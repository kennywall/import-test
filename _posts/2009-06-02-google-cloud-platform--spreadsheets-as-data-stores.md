    I attended many great sessions while at Google I/O.I really started to see the where they are going with using Google Spreadsheets as data stores.I have used as data stores for quite a while, but
    they are really pushing for them to store enterprise data, application data, web site data, and much more.Way back in the day when i was doing non-profit work I went and conducted a needs
    assement at a large educational non-profit.To build a specification for developming a new administrative system.

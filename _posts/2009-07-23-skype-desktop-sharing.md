{% include JB/setup %}<p>Just downloaded the new Skype which introduced desktop sharing.I can now cut out Webex for internal meetings and discussions and have conference calls on skype.I use WebEx heavily for internal meetings, trainings and other types of virtual gatherings.Desktop sharing isnt required in all virtual gatherings, but is a necessary about 60% of the time.If it is built in and easy to do I will do more often.</p>

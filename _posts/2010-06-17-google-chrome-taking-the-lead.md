Google Chrome just keeps winning me over lately. My firefox seems to crash a lot, which seems to be related to my firebug, but not always. 
With Google Chrome in the lead with HTML 5 support, I'm spending more and more time each day using it as my primary browser. I am enjoying what HTML 5 is doing to application development.
Today Google launched improved PDF support with out plugins. With all the PDF's I read, this is pretty big. Half the time my Firefox doesn't open the PDF properly. I have to download and then open locally.
Keep it up Google, I see Chrome definitely taking the lead in the browser game.

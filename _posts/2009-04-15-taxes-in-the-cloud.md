I am last minute e-filing my taxes because my accountant just told me my extension was denied cause they say someone already filed using my SSN? Whole other issue.

So I am working using an online software and it is pretty slow, but that expected because its 4/15.

So I ask myself....are they scaling their infrastructure in the clouds?

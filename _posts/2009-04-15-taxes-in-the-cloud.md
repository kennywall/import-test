    I am last minute e-filing my taxes because my accountant just told me my extension was denied cause they say someone already filed using my SSN?Whole other issue.So I am working using an online
    software and it is pretty slow, but that expected because its 4/15.So I ask myself.are they scaling their infrastructure in the clouds?

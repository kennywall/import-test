    I am starting a new personal tradition.I have never really been into new years resoutions, but I do get excited about the new possibility of each coming here.I also tend to look for ways to
    measure up the ending year and see what I accomplished.I am writing a list of what is real importatnt to me personally and professionally at the moment, and things I would like to do for the
    following year.I am rewriting my personal bio as well.

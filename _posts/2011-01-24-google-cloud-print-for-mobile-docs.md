Google has launched a BETA program of the Google Cloud Print for mobile documents and Gmail for mobile.

Google Cloud Print for mobile allows you to print any document from your smartphone.  You can open a document in Google Docs or in Gmail using your mobile browser and choose "Print" from the dropdown menu in the top left corner.
Currently you need to connect your printer to the Google Cloud Print using a Windows PC. They are planning Linux and Mac support in the near future.
They are rolling this feature out in the US for phones that support HTML5. This includes Android 2.1+ and IOS 3+.
To get more information you can visit the Google Cloud Print Help Center.

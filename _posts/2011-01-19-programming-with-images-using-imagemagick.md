ImageMagick is open source Apache 2.0 project that allows you to programmaticaly create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images.

It can read and write images in over 100 formats:

	GIF
	JPEG
	PDF
	PNG
	TIFF

ImageMagick can scale, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines and shapes
ImageMagick is a command line utility which you can choose from several libraries:

	JMagick for Java
	MagickNet for .NET
	MagickWand for PHP
	IMagick for PHP
	PythonMagick for Python
	RMagick for Ruby

I spent about an hour looking a wide variety of commercial image manipulation applications before I stumbled across ImageMagick. I've seen it before, but don't remember it being so functional.
Its great to see such innovative and powerful open-source projects in a sea of spammy and commercial software offerings.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am trying to find to find an appropriate solution for a friend that will allow him to manage a photo collection.Rather than build something from scratch I thought Id take a look to see whats out there.I came across Plogger, a great open-source web photo gallery.It is an excellent example of quality FREE / Open Source software that has a single purpose and lives up to it.I just quickly downloaded and installed it at a subdomain.</p>

I came across a cloud backup tool the other day called backupify. It runs in the cloud and backs up your cloud.
Very cool.
backupify is pretty easy to setup. It acts like most social aggregators like Friendfeed, however it then backs up your data rather than syndicating it or providing a single feed.
I authorized backupify to access the following accounts:

	Flickr
	Twitter
	Delicious
	Google Docs
	Worpress
	Facebook

It offered a few other service back ups. However they were not services I was either using or concerned about.
Then I could choose either Weekly or Daily backup settings. As well as email when backups run.
Pretty cool tool. It has an archives, history and profile management tools as well. I'll post again in a few days and we'll take a look at what data is available to us.
It is a pretty simple little tool. I can see if becoming pretty valuable for companies that depend on cloud services.

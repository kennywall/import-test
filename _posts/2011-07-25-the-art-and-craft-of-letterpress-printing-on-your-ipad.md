I found a new path to help me define the future of print. I'm going to walk through the history of print, and use the very technology we often kill off, as we blindly roll forward with our new and shiny technology, to define the future of print and publishing.
This idea came from a project someone introduced me to on Kickstarter,called LetterMpress™.
LetterMpress™ will be a virtual letterpress environment, released first on the iPad, that will allow anyone to create authentic-looking letterpress designs and prints.
The design process is the same as the letterpress process that allows you to place and arrange type and cuts on a press bed, lock the type, ink the type, and print. Using the iPad app, you will be able to create unlimited designs, with multiple colors, using authentic vintage wood type and art cuts.
LetterMpress™ lets you place virtual blocks of wood type on a surface, then drag the type images across the iPad, and then move them around to create your design. The iPad is potentially an ideal platform for people to experience the creative aspects of letterpress and typography.
Letterpress has had a growing interest over the past decade amongst designers, artists, and printmakers. It quite possibly is a reaction to the perfect look of laser-printing. Where Letterpress, especially wood type, evokes a handcrafted appearance that accompanies thoughtful, visual, and literal expression.
Unfortunately, much of the letterpress's traditional technology was sold for scrap metal and replaced with computers over the last 30 years. Wood type was burned, thrown in a landfill, or divided up as knick-knacks in antique and craft shops.
The LetterMpress™ Kickstarter project looks to give designers, artists, students, lovers of type, the ability to produce their own authentic letterpress designs and artwork.
The LetterMpress™ Kickstarter project has exceeded its original goal of raising $15,000, and it is just the beginning of using the history of publishing, to help define the future of publishing.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I found a new path to help me define the future of print.Im going to walk through the history of print, and use the very technology we often kill off, as we blindly roll forward with our new and shiny technology, to define the future of print and publishing.This idea came from a project someone introduced me to on Kickstarter,called LetterMpress™.LetterMpress™ will be a virtual letterpress environment, released first on the iPad, that will allow anyone to create authentic-looking letterpress designs and prints.The design process is the same as the letterpress process that allows you to place and arrange type and cuts on a press bed, lock the type, ink the type, and print.</p>

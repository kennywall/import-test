Was just watching on the Rachel Maddow show about how a fiber optic cable was cut in San Jose and San Carlos. Then I searched and found an article in the New York Times.
Good example of how we need more security and redundancy in our networks.
This is right after it ws reported that hackers from Russia and China infiltrated our Electric and other utility grids.
Lots of work we need to do.

{% include JB/setup %}Sometimes you notice things on the Internet and they just don't register for a while.  I've seen many sites displaying their code samples using a Gist by Github, but it hasn't really registered in my head for some reason.

I even created a custom snippet of code the other day for displaying code in myWordpress blog.   The other day I was going through Mashape's documentation and their use of Gist for their PHP API examples finally hit home.
Gist is a simple way to share snippets of code with others. All gists are git repositories, so they are automatically versioned, forkable and usable as a git repository.
I've been creating quite a few Github repositories lately for Mimeo Cloud Print, but Gists are just what I'm looking for when blogging.  They work great for displaying code in technical blog posts without much work.  When done with the blog series I will post the final code in a complete form as a full Github repository.

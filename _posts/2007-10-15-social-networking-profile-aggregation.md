{% include JB/setup %}<p>I have seen a lot of discussion about the use of multiple social networks and how difficult it is to maintain your profile across these networks.I don't want a different profile at each of these networks.  I want my one profile and these networks to come to me.I don't want to have go through a lengthy sign up process. I want to be instantly evaluated upon arrival and either let in.....or what?Every application should treat me like this. I don't have to fill out a form and check my email to validate an email before entering a retail store or restaurant on the street.I am authenticated at the door for the public environment or there is a simple ID or visual check to make sure I am a valid user.</p>

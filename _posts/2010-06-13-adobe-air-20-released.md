{% include JB/setup %}<p>The Adobe AIR team released Adobe Air 2.0 the other day, you can download the latest version now.With Adobe AIR 2.0 you can release AIR applications on:

	Windows
	Mac OS

They claim the biggest improvement is overall efficiency, and without changing your AIR apps, they will now use less CPU and up to 30%  less memory.Multi-touch and gesture enabled API are a new addition, because more touch enabled hardware are taking advantage of Adobe AIR applications.</p>

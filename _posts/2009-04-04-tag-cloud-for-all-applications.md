{% include JB/setup %}<p>Another thing to add to my wish list.It would be nice to have a keyword tag cloud for all my Google applications.The one provided for trends in Google is nice.I would like to see a trends section in Google Docs, Gmail, Calendar and any other Google Application.I think tag cloud and other similiar analytics and trends are helpful in stearing my work.</p>

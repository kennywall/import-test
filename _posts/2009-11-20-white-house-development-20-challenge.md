{% include JB/setup %}The White House recently announced the Development 2.0 Challenge, a Tech Competition for the Developing World.
They are attempting to crowd-source international development initiatives and get away from programs being designed by experts and government officials without sufficient input from citizens, social entrepreneurs, or people.
They are looking forpeople from around the world to submit ideas for solving various development issues. They look to reach out to non-traditional groups including students, social entrepreneurs, and individuals with great ideas for solving a development problem in every sector, including disaster management, health, agriculture, and education.
Definitely exciting to see some more innovation coming from the White House. Crowd sourcing is the ultimate usage of technology for democracy. Although it is kind of socialist too. Hmmmm...

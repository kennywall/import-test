     I came across a cool tool that allows you to visual data in Google Spreadsheets, using the Secure Data Connector. It is a reporting tool that will connect to any Google Spreadsheet and create very advanced visualizations of the data contained in there.

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Here is an <strong>overview</strong> of this tool: <a href="http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/04-08-2009/0005002822&amp;EDATE=" target="_blank">http://news.prnewswire.com/DisplayReleaseContent.aspx?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/04-08-2009/0005002822&amp;EDATE=</a>
     </li>
     <li>Here is a <strong>demo</strong> of the actual tool: <a href="http://pivot.panorama.com/Panorama/FoodMart.htm" target="_blank">http://pivot.panorama.com/Panorama/FoodMart.htm</a> (make sure and drill down in the spreadsheet, its huge)
     </li>
     <li>Here is a <strong>video</strong> explaining how its used: <a href="http://www.panorama.com/google/pivot-table-tutorial/" target="_blank">http://www.panorama.com/google/pivot-table-tutorial/</a>
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     <strong><span class="c1">What does this mean in short?</span></strong> It means you can basically use Google Spreadsheets as a data warehouse and dump data through the API into spreadsheets from any other system. You can then provide an interactive visualization of that data in a full or widget view that you can embed anywhere. Pretty slick stuff!!!

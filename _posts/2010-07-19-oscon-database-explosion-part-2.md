     <a href="http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/"

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>
          <a href="http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/products/mysql_appliance"
              target="_blank">MySQL Appliance</a>
     </li>

     <li>
          <a href="http://www.schoonerinfotech.com/products/memcached_nosql_cache_appliance"
              target="_blank">Memcached/NoSQL Appliance</a>
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     Looks like they have the solution for anyone looking to deploy MySQL or NoSQL key-value stores in their data center. I could see this being used internally or offered up as a cloud database service.

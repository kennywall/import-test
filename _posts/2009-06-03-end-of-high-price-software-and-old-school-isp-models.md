{% include JB/setup %}<p>This month we are done with a hostage internet service provider (ISP) at WebEvents Global where I work.When I started we were already under contract with this ISP.We werent using the T1 connection, however we were still using the rack hosting.After working my way through the sales and tech support I made it to what I guess is the top of the ladder.He expressed no interest in negotiating or even providing the services they had promised.</p>

<p>
     Google released a new Google Books API this week. The new Books API will allow developers to build mobile and web applications using the more than 15 million books titles available on books.google.com. The Books API allows searching of books metadata, pricing and working with users Google Book accounts to retrieve and manage their bookshelves and the titles they contain. The new Google Books API provides: OAuth 2.0 support Integration with the Google APIs Console Library support for multiple programming languages JSON request and responses Book titles that allow for downloading, return a link to the full book. Currently only ePub is the only supportd format, and some books may require purchasing before a download link is provided. The previous GData API and Javascript API will still be available, but ongoing development work will be focused on the new Google Books API.

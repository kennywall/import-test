{% include JB/setup %}I am always talking about how many software and service providers out there should really focus on doing one thing and doing it very well.
This is a personal goal of mine as well.
I cam across another web service this evening that I would put into that category. It is called ShareThis.
The provide web site sharing tools that are plug and play. They also provide advanced tools like API, Reporting and more.
Very well done, profiessional. I highly recommend it.

     I am always talking about how many software and service providers out there should really focus on doing one thing and doing it very well. This is a personal goal of mine as well. I cam across another web service this evening that I would put into that category. It is called <a href="http://sharethis.com/publishers/">ShareThis</a>. The provide web site sharing tools that are plug and play. They also provide advanced tools like API, Reporting and more. Very well done, profiessional. I highly recommend it.

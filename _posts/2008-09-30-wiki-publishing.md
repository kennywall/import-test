    I have used several wiki environments to develop projects and provide oversight for several social media marketing campaigns.I am currently using Google Sites pretty heavily for writing several
    books and for building my strategy for work.I spend a great deal of time cultivating and gardening the wiki to keep up to date and keep my overview.I would like a simple publish or build feature
    allowing me to choose from Sitemap which sections and pages I would like to publish and have it create an output format from my selection.Then I could choose to publish as PDF, HTML or other
    popular format.

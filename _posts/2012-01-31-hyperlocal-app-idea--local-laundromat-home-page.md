{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am sitting at the&nbsp;Wash Tub Laundromat in Manhattan Beach, CA&nbsp;doing my laundry tonight. I was working on my Macbook and the owner of the laundromat asked me if I was able to get wifi on my laptop?
I explained that I have a Verizon USB stick to get my Internet connection, since there wasn&rsquo;t wifi available. He said he had talked to Time Warner Cable and they said they&rsquo;d install free Internet for him, but it had been months and nothing. I&rsquo;m assuming they have some sort of public spaces package that routes users to a home page, upon connecting and monetizes the Internet using advertising.
The laundromat owner said he&rsquo;d just pay for Internet himself. I told him about&nbsp;CityGrid local advertising,&nbsp;and said he could monetize the home page and probably end up paying for the Internet through local advertising.
Seems like a great idea for a local web application, one that helps laundromat, coffee shop and other business owners set up a default home page for their router, and make money from it using&nbsp;CityGrid local places and advertising.
It would be easy to go beyond just ads on a single splash page and build a quality local directory that introduces customers to other products, services and business in the local area.
As I&rsquo;m traveling, and talking to small business owners about ideas for web and mobile apps, I will keep sharing with developers here, so you can take advantage of these opportunities.</p>

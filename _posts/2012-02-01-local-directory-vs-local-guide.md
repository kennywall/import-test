    When I started working with the&nbsp;CityGrid Places API&nbsp;I needed a project to help me learning about how to use the API, and wrap my head around whats possible when building local web
    applications.I built&nbsp;Hyp3rL0cal&nbsp;which is a local web directory, that I wrote in PHP, then created Python and Ruby versions as well.While I think local directories are still a very
    valuable and relevant part of the CityGrid network, I do not think they reflect the future of local web applications.So I”m spending time trying to brainstorm what is next, and I want to explore
    the difference between a local directory and local guide.In my opinion a local directory is a web application that provides search and browsing mechanisms for users to discover local businesses
    and places on the web.

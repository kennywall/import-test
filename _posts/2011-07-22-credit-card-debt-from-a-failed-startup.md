    <img style="padding: 15px;" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/startup-credit-card-payments.png" alt="" width="300" align="right" />Here is a little reminder for all the startup
    hungry folks out there. This is a dashboard widget for my debt consolidation, for all the credit card debt I racked up doing a startup called Social Media Squad. I don't regret any of it. I
    learned so much, and it only failed because of the recession. If I had been able to ride another 4 months I would have been able to make it. We were adding new customers, and had a bunch of
    people working for us. We just ran out of money to operate. I hope it can be a reminder for all the startup crazed folks out there looking to make it big. I sure hope you do, but remember there
    is a good chance you'll be doing what I'm doing also. Paying down 60K in credit card debt. I only look in here every 6 months, because its a painful reminder. I figured I'd share my pain
    publicly, for others to learn from.

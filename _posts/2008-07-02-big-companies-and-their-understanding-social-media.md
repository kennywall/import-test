I just got off a conference call with a big, well known manufacturer.  They are launching a new "viral campaign" this fall.I came to the table with many social and viral ideas including widgets and a simple / slick OpenSocial / Facebook application.They weren't interested. They wanted to start small and keep things focused and manageable. Which makes sense. Except there was nothing viral about the campaign except that the word viral was used everywhere.I understand that big brands are wary of Social Media Marketing, and taking small manageable baby steps in the beginning is important. However you should call it what it is. Online marketing, not viral social media marketing.Just venting after the call.....getting down my thoughts.

We are using SQL Server 2008 as our primary database currently. We do a lot of replication and other SQL server advanced features.
At first the management studio really frustrated me, its clunky and pop ups and warns you about everything. The more I use it, the more I get it though.
I need to replicate sets of stored procedure and make a few changes and re-run to create a new set. The management script as -&gt; Create To option is very nice.

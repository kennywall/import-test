<p>
     I have checked out and downloaded code from plenty of github repositories. I've even help manage a couple of private repositories for clients. I have never actually shared an open source repository before. A virgin of sorts. I posted the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API PHP REST Client today. It is a simple PHP Class for consuming the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print REST API. It the PEAR Request2 library to make REST calls against any of the REST service endpoints. It is the first of hopefully many code libraries and applications I will be open sourcing and publishing to github.

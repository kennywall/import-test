{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am by no means an IT architecture specialist, although I have a lot of experience in this area.I have deployed infrastructure to support large conferences in single locations and across multiple global locations simultaneously.I have done this for companies including Google and SAP.I deployed this infrastructure using Amazon Web Services (EC2, S3, CloudFront, EBS, etc.)
So I have an understanding of what it takes to deploy on the Amazon Cloud, and knowledge of what it takes to scale and be redundant.</p>

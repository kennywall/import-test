    <img src="http://about.mappyfriends.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/readwriteweb.jpg" alt="" align="right" />A <a href="http://www.kinlane.com/2010/12/ideation-and-project-evolution/" target=
    "_blank">project I'm moving off the back-burner and into the public domain</a> is a project I called Tech Blogger Analysis. My GF is Audrey Watters @ ReadWriteWeb, so I get exposed to an authors
    daily perspective in the tech blogging world. I started harvesting all the RSS feeds from <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com" target="_blank">ReadWriteWeb</a>, <a href=
    "http://www.techcrunch.com" target="_blank">Techcrunch</a>, <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com" target="_blank">O'Reilly</a>, <a href="http://www.mashable.com" target="_blank">Mashable</a>,
    <a href="http://www.venturebeat.com" target="_blank">VentureBeat</a>, and <a href="http://www.gigaom.com" target="_blank">GigaOm</a>. Upon harvest I would organize the post and curate author
    details, tags, etc. I had a whole bunch of scripts I'd run to clean up, organize and centralize meta data. I would then pull the tweets for each post daily using BackType. I would then build
    profiles for each twitter user with their # of followers, tweets etc....as well as their Trustrnk using InfoChimps. When I started I was profile the individual blogs, and quickly saw the true
    value is in the tech blogger and their brand. I think there is an important story here:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>What topics to they cover most? Specialize in?
      </li>
      <li>Who has the strong brand? Number of Followers? Importance in certain topics.
      </li>
      <li>Who are their influential followers? Loyalty? Trustrnk?
      </li>
      <li>What do their followers pay attention to?
      </li>
    </ul>There is a lot of information here. I had the data harvesting for last 6 months, it was being refined and had a crude web interface setup. I wanted to provide a directory of Tech Bloggers
    and their brands with real-time stats on what they are writing on their personal and professional blogs. Think Postrank, BackType, Crunchbase for Bloggers. I think the future of tech journalism
    is about the individual writers and their brands. I think writers would find this information valuable. I also think industry leaders would find this information valuable also. I see a lot of
    corporations investing in tech writers and their brand. I see writer brands becoming just as, or more important than the domain based brands we see today. I would like to restart this project,
    but just can't afford the EC2, RDS and bandwidth charges if I'm not moving forward. If you are interested, you can contact me.

A project I'm moving off the back-burner and into the public domain is a project I called Tech Blogger Analysis. My GF is Audrey Watters @ ReadWriteWeb, so I get exposed to an authors daily perspective in the tech blogging world.
I started harvesting all the RSS feeds from ReadWriteWeb, Techcrunch, O'Reilly, Mashable, VentureBeat, and GigaOm.
Upon harvest I would organize the post and curate author details, tags, etc. I had a whole bunch of scripts I'd run to clean up, organize and centralize meta data.
I would then pull the tweets for each post daily using BackType.
I would then build profiles for each twitter user with their # of followers, tweets etc....as well as their Trustrnk using InfoChimps.
When I started I was profile the individual blogs, and quickly saw the true value is in the tech blogger and their brand. I think there is an important story here:

	What topics to they cover most? Specialize in?
	Who has the strong brand? Number of Followers? Importance in certain topics.
	Who are their influential followers? Loyalty? Trustrnk?
	What do their followers pay attention to?

There is a lot of information here. I had the data harvesting for last 6 months, it was being refined and had a crude web interface setup. I wanted to provide a directory of Tech Bloggers and their brands with real-time stats on what they are writing on their personal and professional blogs.  Think Postrank, BackType, Crunchbase for Bloggers.
I think the future of tech journalism is about the individual writers and their brands. I think writers would find this information valuable. I also think industry leaders would find this information valuable also. I see a lot of corporations investing in tech writers and their brand. I see writer brands becoming just as, or more important than the domain based brands we see today.
I would like to restart this project, but just can't afford the EC2, RDS and bandwidth charges if I'm not moving forward. If you are interested, you can contact me.

I am currently taking a company and reconstructing its entire server and infrastructure platform to operate in the clouds.<p></p>
It is a lot of planning, work and just readjustment in thinking on how to deploy a server infrastructure.<p></p>
However it is so worth it. It is such a more scalable and resilient platform than depending on your own server infrastructure.<p></p>
I will be outlining more about how and why I am doing this as I get time. Its been a while since I posted because I have been so busy. More to come...

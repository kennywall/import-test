Just came across a cool web application called <a href="http://bundle.com/">Bundle</a> that lets you see how people like you save and spend their money?<p></p>
You can use <a href="http://bundle.com/">Bundle</a> to compare yourself by age, location, income and household status.<p></p>
I love the tools out there that help us understand our money and spending.

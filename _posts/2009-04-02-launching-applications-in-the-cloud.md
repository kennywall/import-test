{% include JB/setup %}<p>Been reading several high quality posts about a new social service that allows you to check the availability of your username across many social networks. This is a great way to protect your "brand" in the social media space.
Sounds like a great application.
Too bad I can't see it.....get a big phat service unavailable when trying to view it.
Obviously they didn't develop their application with a serious IT plan and not built on the cloud. If they had deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance with a load-balancer...they could have seen the traffic spikes.... and scaled immediately.
Now they've made a bad first impression, left a bad taste in my mouth...and I probably will move on, forget.
UPDATE: I just got in....very nice application.</p>

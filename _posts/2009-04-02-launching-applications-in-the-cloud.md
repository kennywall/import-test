    Been reading several high quality posts about a new social service that allows you to check the availability of your username across many social networks. This is a great way to protect your
    "brand" in the social media space. Sounds like a great application. Too bad I can't see it.....get a big phat service unavailable when trying to view it. Obviously they didn't develop their
    application with a serious IT plan and not built on the cloud. If they had deployed on an Amazon EC2 instance with a load-balancer...they could have seen the traffic spikes.... and scaled
    immediately. Now they've made a bad first impression, left a bad taste in my mouth...and I probably will move on, forget. UPDATE: I just got in....very nice application.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am going through Diggs new API to see what added benefit it brings to the table.Digg usually is lower on the radar of many of my clients when it comes to sharing their news and information.Although it definitely can come into play pretty quickly.So I am curious what the new benefits the new Digg API brings to event managers and other potential clients.</p>

{% include JB/setup %}<p>Amazon just added another quality web service to their killer lineup.  They released Amazon DevPay in Limited Beta, which is a simple-to-use billing and account service that assists developers in getting paid for applications they build using Amazon Web Services.Its a layer built on their Flexible Payment Services and allows me to integrate it into applications I build and allows me to create and manage the billing system for the application.I allows me to take advantage of various payment setups such as recurring and usage-based pricing models.Interesting addition....I still haven't completely grasped how SimpleDB is going to be worked into my architecture.  Lots to do!</p>

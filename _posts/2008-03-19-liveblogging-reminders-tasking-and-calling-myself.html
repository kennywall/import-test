I have been using Jott for that last few months to record tasks, record events, publish blogs, and other general communications by calling Jott and leaving a voice mail or "jott" and it translates and sends to the link that I dictate.<br /><br />I am pioneering using this for live blogging of events and sending out user generate reporters.<br /><br />Today I came across Utterz which is a simlar to Jott, but adds in the pictures and videos but utilizes a larger list of links you can post to.<br /><br />Utterz seems like a true live blogging tool, where Jott seems like a personal assistant and publishing tool.

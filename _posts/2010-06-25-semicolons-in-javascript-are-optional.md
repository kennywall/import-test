{% include JB/setup %}<p>JavaScript is a scripting language where semicolons as statement terminators are optional.I have never found a conversation about this, I just stumbled across one and found it interesting.Some of the points the author makes about why you should use semicolons are:

	Spec is cryptic and JavaScript implementations differ
	You cant minify JavaScript code without semicolons
	Its good coding style
	Semicolon insertion bites back in return statements

I am pretty obsessive about using semi-colons in my JavaScript.It just makes it neat and organized in my opinion.Also keeps me in sync with my PHP programming as well.</p>

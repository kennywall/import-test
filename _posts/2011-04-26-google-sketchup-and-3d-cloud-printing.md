{% include JB/setup %}<p>Im doing a lot of researching and thinking about the future of commercial printing, 3D printing, and manufacturing.Yesterday I was brainstorming on 3D printing and manufacturing with Google.Tonight Im learning more about Google SketchUp,which Google added toGoogle Apps in December of 2010.Google SketchUp allows anyone to build 3D models to the STL file format, a standard for the 3D print industry.3D printers like Shapeways lets you upload your STL files, print and order them in their physical form.</p>

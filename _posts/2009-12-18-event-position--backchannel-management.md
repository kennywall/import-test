{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am doing a lot of research around using social tools in event and conference planning right now.I am researching usage of Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and other social tools in event presentation and speaking at the moment.Planning, preparation and then ultimately presenting a session or keynote at a conference is hard enough.With all the new social tools being used by conference attendees in real-time at sessions, a presenter can hardly ignore this, and should be integrating into their planning and operations.Conference planners should provide tools to assist speakers and presenters to help them be as successful as possible, however as a presenter you cant depend on this.</p>

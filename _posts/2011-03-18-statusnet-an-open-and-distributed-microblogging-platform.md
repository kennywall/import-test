Think of it as your own private Twitter service.
StatusNet offers similar functionality to Twitter, but allows business and individuals to control their own services and data, while still inter-operating with existing microblogging platformslike Twitter and Facebook.
<a title="StatusNet is an Open Source Platform" href="http://status.net/open-source">StatusNet is open source</a>, and provides <a title="APIs for custom integration" href="http://status.net/wiki/API">APIs for custom integration</a>.
The platform provides a <a title="Directory of Themes, Plugins, and Applications" href="http://status.net/open-source/add-ons">directory of themes, plugins, and applications</a> built on StatusNet.

     <a title="Identi.ca" href="http://identi.ca/">Identi.ca</a>, a popular microblogging service runs on the StatusNet platform.
     I consider platforms like StatusNet very important for the future of the Internet. They offer open, standards based solutions to communication and collaboration while still inter-operating with other major platforms.

    with where each browser is going with their support for the <a title="Web Notifications API" href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/WebNotifications/publish/">Web Notifications API</a>, and I'm sure
    someone will invest in you. Maybe <a title="Union Square Ventures" href="http://www.usv.com/">Union Square Ventures</a>? Fred believes <em>"<a title="Mobile Notifications" href=

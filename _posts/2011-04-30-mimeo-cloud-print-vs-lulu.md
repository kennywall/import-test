One search term I've seen come up in my Google Analytics frequestly is: 
Mimeo.com vs. Lulu.com
I wanted to help people understand the difference.
Lulu.com lets you make, self-publish, print and sell print-on-demand books, e-books, photo books and calendars.
Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API Platform lets you build Lulu's.
This means you can build self-publishing web sites and applications that leverage the printing power of Mimeo.com</p>

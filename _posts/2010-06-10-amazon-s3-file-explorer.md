{% include JB/setup %}Amazon Web Services finally added an S3 Bucket explorer to the Amazon Console. I was mentioning last week about how mature the offerings in the AWS console are getting, and how the the whole suite of Amazon Web Services is ready for use by Small Business. 
The Amazon S3 interface is pretty simple, but then again it is simple storage. With this addition you can easily manage your:

	Servers and Process Power with Amazon EC2
	Raw Object / File storage (PDF, doc, jpg, gif, png, etc.) with Amazon S3
	International content delivery for PDF, Images, Video, Audio using Amazon Cloudfront
	Simple and Releational Database Storage with Amazon SimpleDB and Amazon RDS
	Scaling with Amazon Elastic Load Balancing and Autoscaling

All of this is available through the Amazon Console. Amazon is the leader when it come to Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and has long been driving cloud applications in the SaaS and PaaS space.
I think as the Amazon Console matures you will see more small business IT managers and owners adopting Amazon cloud services.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>A team of researchers at MIT have developed a way to print solar cells, just like printing out of an office printer.Almost as inexpensive as printing a photo from your inkjet, the simple solar cell have been created on a flimsy sheet, formed from special inks deposited on the paper.The new technology, is reported in a paper in the journal pf Advanced Materials, published online July 8.The paper is co-authored by Karen Gleason, the Alexander and Michael Kasser Professor of Chemical Engineering; Professor of Electrical Engineering Vladimir Bulovi?; graduate student Miles Barr; and six other students.</p>

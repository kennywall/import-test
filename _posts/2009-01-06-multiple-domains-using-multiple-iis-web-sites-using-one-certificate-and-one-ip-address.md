    I havent researched this one in a while, I am glad I had the chance to research for a new project.I need to be able to setup many sites using a single domain.So each site will be a subdomain
    within this chose domain.I have always used one web site on Windows Server because I would need multiple IP Addreses and SSL certificates.I had research the wildcard certificates a couple of
    times, but the multiple IP address need always trumped.

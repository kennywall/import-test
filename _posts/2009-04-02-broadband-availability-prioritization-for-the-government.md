{% include JB/setup %}With this current administration we have a great opportunity to really address the availability of broadband across the United States.
We are lagging behind the rest of the world in broadband availability. This is such a yesterday issue...we need to get on with it and move on.
I understand our growth has been stunted by the previous administration. However its no excuse.
Let's make broadband a priority and get it available at a low cost through America and move on to other important issues like cloud computing.

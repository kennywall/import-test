{% include JB/setup %}<p>Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) announced the availability of the final two documents produced by its Open Cloud Standards Incubator, which is working to establish a strategy for cloud standards development. The documents: are

	Use Cases and Interactions for Managing Clouds
	Architecture for Managing Clouds

These two documents will be the foundation for DMTF's ongoing cloud standards work. Curious to see where the OpenStack plugs into this vision, there are a lot of players to keep track of in the cloud computing standards and open source game.</p>

     I just made the upgrade from my IPhone 3GS to IPhone 4. I 've been waiting because it is really a luxury, not a need. However my IPhone is getting slower and slower and was actually keeping me from doing work. <img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/IPhone/iphone-4-in-hand.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> I chose not to have the store transfer my data, I enjoy doing myself and rewiring my world. Finding new ways of doing things if possible. I just finished downloading the handful of apps I use daily:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Google
     </li>
     <li>Twitter
     </li>
     <li>Facebook
     </li>
     <li>Evernote
     </li>
     <li>Instagram
     </li>
     <li>Foursquare
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     I have a Remote Desktop Client (<a class="zem_slink" title="Remote Desktop Protocol" rel="wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_Desktop_Protocol">RDP</a>) that is essential for server support, but not a daily use application. I found it interesting what apps I rely on daily. I tend to browse more than I rely on apps, even though I have downloaded quite a few, they don't stick. I'm sure Kaia will download plenty of games on there during the time(s) we are together, wait she has a new IPod?

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I just did my taxes and broke down my spending for last year.I was newly divorced last year so I didnt have any restraing on my social spending budget.I wont give numbers on what I spent, but I was blown away what I spent wining and dining business customers as well as exploring the singles dating and partying scene.Well now that I am living way out in the woods I am putting myself on a forced money saving program.I dont eat out.</p>

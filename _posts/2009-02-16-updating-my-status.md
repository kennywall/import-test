{% include JB/setup %}<p>Was just playing around more with helltxt which is a multi-social network status update tool.I had come across it a long time ago but never really got the time to play with it.Now I update my status enough across Myspace, Facebook, and Linkedin enough that that the tool sounds intriguing.I tend to star and label new applications I find in my Google Reader so I can find and review later.So I just dug it up and started playing again.</p>

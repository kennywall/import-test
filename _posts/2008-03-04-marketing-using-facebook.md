     Was just reading <a href="http://www.digitalpodcast.com/podcastnews/2008/03/03/facebook-marketing-opportunties/">Facebook Marketing Opportunities</a> over at <span class="c1">Digital Podcast.</span>
     <br />
     <br />
     I am currently playing around with several strategies for marketing our companies products on Facebook.
     <br />
     <br />
     His statement about 8 ways to market on Facebook really stood out, and I have seen reciprocated on several other core marketing blogs:
     <br />
</p>

<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>Application Development
     </li>

     <li>Group Participation
     </li>

     <li>Paid Groups
     </li>

     <li>Targete Ads
     </li>

     <li>Newsfeed Advertising
     </li>

     <li>Beacon Advertising
     </li>

     <li>Guerrilla Individual Targeting
     </li>
</ul>

<p>
     I am also exploring other methods for targeting around social graph marketing to specific measured social graphs for a focused but broad reach.

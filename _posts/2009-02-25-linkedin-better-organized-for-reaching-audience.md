    I am spending about 30 minutes each day extending my companies reach onto popular social networks LinkedIn and Facebook.I reallky find LinkedIn is much more organized for such business efforts.It
    is much easier to reach people through LinkedIn QA.It allows me to ask questions and answer questions on topics that are relevant to my industry and company.Facebook is great for interacting with
    friends, but LinkedIn is just better suited for business networking.

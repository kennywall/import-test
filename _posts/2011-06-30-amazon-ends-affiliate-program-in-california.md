    Amazon sent me an email about the recent signing of the online sales tax law by California Governor Brown, which would force online retailers who have no physical presence in California, to
    collect the same levies as bricks-and-mortar stores.As a result of this, contracts with all California residents participating in the Amazon Associates Program are terminated effective today,
    June 29, 2011.California residents will no longer receive advertising fees for sales referred toAmazon.com,Endless.com,MYHABIT.

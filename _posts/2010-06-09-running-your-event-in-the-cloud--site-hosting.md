{% include JB/setup %}Hosting a web site for an event or conference can be costly. Traffic to  the web site spikes around email campaigns, call for papers,  registration opening, before and during the event.
Hosting  providers that can handle the volume of traffic around events and  conferences can be expensive. The Amazon Cloud is an excellent place to  meet the demanding needs of the event.
Amazon Web Services has  several services that can be taken advantage of:

	Amazon EC2 for web site hosting, cloud email hosting.
	Amazon RDS for relational  database management using MySQL
	Amazon S3 for storage of PDF,  Word Documents, Video, and Audio
	Amazon CloudFront for  distribution of content to US, European, and Asian zones for regional  delivery
	Elastic Load Balncing and Auto Scaling for event web site  and web application scaling to meet traffic needs

One of  the cornerstones of Cloud Computing is the pay for what you use, utility  pricing. This type of pricing and scalability fits well with delivery  Internet services around events and conferences.
It is common to  double or triple your server, storage and bandwidth during important  event milestones. Then once it is done you just need a handful of pages  with little or no traffic.
I'm running 20+ events at any time in  the clouds, I often scale from 10 server to 20 servers to meet the  demand. Amazon Cloud works well.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I am seeing more and more data available at the Recovery.org web site.The site provides some great overview of money distributed, but it takes forever to really dive into specific aspects of where the money is being spent at the local, state or federal level.What I would like to see is on this Investments by Agency page, in addition to available and paid out amounts by agency is add a 3rd column with an XML / JSON data feed of exactly how this money is being spent.Also on this Investments by State page I would like to see the same.</p>

{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was just reading through my Amazon Web Services Newsletter and came across another cool service built on their infrastructure.It is called phanfare, a subscription-based photo and video sharing service for serious amateurs and pro photographers.I definitely feel that Amazon S3 is the best storage for your videos and photos.I store all my raw image, video and other files at Amazon S3.Then I secondarily keep them at the cloud application of my choice such as Flickr, Youtube or otherwise.</p>

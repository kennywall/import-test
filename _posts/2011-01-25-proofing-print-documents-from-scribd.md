{% include JB/setup %}<p>I recently created a couple of working examples using Scribd API and the Mimeo Connect Cloud Print API:

	Pulling a PDF Using Scribd API and PHP
	Proofing a Scribd PDF Using Mimeo Connect

I want to help developers integrate Scribd document storage and Mimeo printing into their applications.You can see this in action on my working example, Pulling a PDF from Scribd and Proofing with Mimeo.I have also created a git and svn repository so you can check out these projects:

	git (github) repository
	svn (google code) repository

I will be updating this code base whenever I do new work or prototypes around Scribd and Mimeo Connect Cloud Print.</p>

{% include JB/setup %}I see a lot of conference badges. <a href="http://www.webeventsglobal.com">WebEvents Global</a> specializes in print on demand badges that make the conference check-in experience a breeze. <img class="alignnone c1" title="Google I/O" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3578/3574278779_e26a7c1f3d.jpg" alt="" width="250" align="right" /> I just finished reading a blot post about <a href="http://www.graphpaper.com/2010/06-11_a-book-on-a-hook">Book on a Hook</a>, a badge from <a href="http://www.thewebandbeyond.nl/2010/website/">The Web and Beyond 2010</a> event, held in Amsterdam. They showcase badge being a useful as book that the attendee can actually get value out of, beyond just identification. <a href="http://code.google.com/events/io/2010/">Google I/O</a> created a very informative and entertaining booklet for their 2009 event. I'm not 100% sold on the usefulness of your badge being a book, but I can how for some events it might work well. I've brainstormed with various people on what makes the perfect event badge, from a high tech RFID card to giving every attendee an IPod Touch for use as a badge. I would like to hear other innovative ideas for badges from attendees and event managers.

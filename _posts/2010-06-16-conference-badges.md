     I see a lot of conference badges. WebEvents Global specializes in print on demand badges that make the conference check-in experience a breeze. I just finished reading a blot post about Book on a Hook, a badge from The Web and Beyond 2010 event, held in Amsterdam. They showcase badge being a useful as book that the attendee can actually get value out of, beyond just identification. Google I/O created a very informative and entertaining booklet for their 2009 event. I'm not 100% sold on the usefulness of your badge being a book, but I can how for some events it might work well. I've brainstormed with various people on what makes the perfect event badge, from a high tech RFID card to giving every attendee an IPod Touch for use as a badge. I would like to hear other innovative ideas for badges from attendees and event managers.

     One of the platforms I depend upon for my memory was hacked today. This afternoon, Evernote let everyone know that the platform was compromised and forced a reset of all passwords. While I’d prefer all platforms I depend on could thwart any hacks, it seems like security breaches are becoming par for the course. I appreciate that Evernote immediately forced a password reset and because I use the desktop app, I immediately was prompted to update my password.   I also enjoy seeing the OAuth flow in action, where reciprocity providers like Zapier immediately take action.  By 2:57 PM I get an email from Evernote, letting me know of situation: Next at 3:56 PM I receive an email from Zapier, letting me know I should have received email from Evernote and to check my connections: I immediately update my OAuth token for Evernote, via the Zapier dashboard: Next I get an email from Evernote, letting me know I’ve successfully been connected to Zapier. I really like seeing OAuth in action. It makes me really evaluate how my network of cloud services can work together. OAuth and reciprocity services like Zapier help me integrate, automate and make my world go around in a secure way I can depend on. There was a security breach today, on the Evernote platform, a service I depend on, but because of quick action by Evernote as well as Zapier, my Google Docs and Evernote integration has resumed, migrating vital data and content securely after only a minor disruption.

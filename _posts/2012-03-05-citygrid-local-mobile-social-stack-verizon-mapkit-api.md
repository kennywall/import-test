{% include JB/setup %}<p>I&rsquo;m spending more time building, what I&rsquo;ve dubbed the&nbsp;CityGrid Local, Mobile, Social Stack, a list of APIs, platforms and tools that you can use in your local-mobile applications.&nbsp;With the latest move by&nbsp;Foursquare to join the OpenStreetMaps&nbsp;movement, I&rsquo;m focused on finding the best mapping tools for the CityGrid Local, Mobile, Social Stack.First on my list of alternative mapping solutions is&nbsp;Verizon Mapkit API, which provides location-based services that include maps, search, traffic and static directions.&nbsp;The Verizon Mapkit API is centered on a map object that provides a tile-based solution supporting multiple layers such road map/satellite/hybrid, traffic, and routes--with built-in controls for standard map operations such as panning and zooming using the host device&rsquo;s native gestures.The MapKit also provides a full set of search APIs delivering geocoding, geolocation and access to local content:

Address Search (Geocoding)
Reverse Geocoding
Local Search
Fuel Price Search
Movie Theaters
Movie Show-Times
Events
Event Venues
Traffic Incidents
Static Directions

The Verizon Mapkit API does not have a web API currently, but does&nbsp;support native application development on Android, iOS, Blackberry and Brew MP platforms.</p>

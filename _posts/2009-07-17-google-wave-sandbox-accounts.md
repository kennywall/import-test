{% include JB/setup %}<p>I received a Google Wave Sandbox account because I attended the Google IO Conference back in May.They have limited access to the API and Sandbox until it stabilized.I was reading their blog today and they are going to open up the Google Wave API to many people who have submitted their requests.So if you havent requested access, make sure you do.And let them know your plans, it will influence their decision.</p>

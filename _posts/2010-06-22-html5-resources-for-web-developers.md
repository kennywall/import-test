Today they launched a new HTML 5 resource site called HTML5Rocks! They are launching the site with nine HTML5 tutorials: Introduction to Chrome Developer Tools, Part One Best Practices for a Faster Web App with HTML5 A Beginner's Guide to Using the Application Cache Practical Guide to Take Your TODO List Offline Reading local files in JavaScript A Simple Trip Meter using the Geolocation API Using the Notifications API A Simple TODO list using HTML5 WebDatabases Quick Guide to Implementing the HTML5 Audio Tag In addition to the tutorials, they give you an HTML 5 code playground for playing with code in real-time and seeing how the browser reacts. The site is a great start, complete with an HTML 5 reference library. They are looking for feedback on what developers would like to see next. Some great tools for learning HTML 5.

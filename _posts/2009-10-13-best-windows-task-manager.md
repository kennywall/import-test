     I was following <a href="http://lifehacker.com/">Lifehackers</a> <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5380512/best-windows-task-manager-alternative-process-explorer">best windows task manager</a> vote, and they named <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653.aspx">process explorer</a> as the best. So I downloaded to check out. I like it.... It gives you all the information on what is running on your windows machine. It fills in the gaps and gives me what I've been looking for all along. It definitely gives you better control over what is running on your system and how to optimize. Well if your a geek...

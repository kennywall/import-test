     Seed funding and startups isn't something I normally write about on my blog. I tend to be more vocal about the technology, than the money. Through exposure from Audrey and the ReadWriteStart Channel I am paying more attention to this world again. I have plenty of business planning exposure from working at Palo Alto Software, but always felt like I had moved on during that time and didn't really jive with the "business planning" community. 500 Startups launched their new web site today. I'm impressed with Dave McClue's approach to tech start-up financing and the portfolio of tech startups they have: AppBistro AwayFind EcoMom Erply Estately FlowTown Foodspotting GroupSpaces inDinero KISSmetrics Medialets Mogotix MyGengo OtherInbox Payvment Rapportive Recurly SendGrid SiteJabber SlideShare Tello TransFS Twilio Udemy WakeMate Wildfire Interactive Zozi I am spending more time watching the latest generation of technology startups. Slideshare, Twilio and Rapportive are three I am watching. I had the pleasure of working with Christine Tsai, one of the 500 Startup team members during her time at Google, we worked on Google I/O together. I will be watching the existing and new tech startups that 500 Startups invest in.

     I am seeing Twitter used as a tool for measuring the buzz around an event or topic. It definitely has become an effective way for measuring the number of people talking about a topic and the tone of that conversation. It also allows you to dive into the detail of what people are saying and get some valuable feedback from your potential customers and fanbase.

{% include JB/setup %}<p>Tired of sending people to Amazon, Rackspace, or GoGrid.You can now start your own cloud computing provider.TelasticStack allows you to offer your own brand of cloud servers:

	Turnkey Cloud Platform
	Deployment Within Days
	No UpFron Investment
	Scalable Cloud Server
	Modern Virtualization Back-End
	Full Managed Operations

They say they have cloud hosting solutions for:

	Existing hosting providers
	Cloud Startups
	Private Clouds

Seems like a viable business model in the cloud computing game.With everyone jumping on the cloud bandwagon a private label solution seems like a perfect option.</p>

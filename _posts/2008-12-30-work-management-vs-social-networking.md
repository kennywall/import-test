{% include JB/setup %}<p>When I start working I tend to open a handful of work-based applications that I need open all the time while I work.A few of the must have applications are:

	Google Home Page
	GMail
	Google Calendar
	Eclipse
	SQL Server Manager
	Remote Desktop

A few applications that I open up that are not critical, but allow me to communicate and manage my network are:

	Skype
	Windows Live Messenger
	Yahoo
	Facebook
	Myspace
	LinkedIn
	Twitter

Just shows how some applicaitons become business critical for me and others are not.Seems I could get more done business wise within my Facebook or LinkedIn profiles.Need more applications and tools for doing this.</p>

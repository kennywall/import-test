{% include JB/setup %}Was just viewing my last blog post and noticed the Google Sidewiki that I had installed recently.
I haven't given it much thought since I installed.
Then it asked me to comment on one of my blog posts. It says:
As the page owner, you can write a special entry that will remain the top entry for this page.
What should I write? What is the best tone to take when comment on your blog or page?

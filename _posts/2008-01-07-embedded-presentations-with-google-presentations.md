I have started building OWS Network system based presentations using Google Docs Presentations.  This helps me explain to customers how they can manage their systems using our tools.I noticed you can now publish the spreadsheet as an embedded presentation.  This is nice for presentations that I will be publishing within sites.I will have to try and see if I can upload these to other sites and / or reference them from other sites.

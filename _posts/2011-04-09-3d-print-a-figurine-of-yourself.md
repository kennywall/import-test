<img class="c1" src="http://kinlane-productions.s3.amazonaws.com/3D-Printing/3d-printing-souveniers.png" alt="" width="125" align="right" />A group of innovators called [BlablabLAB][1] have integrated a Kinect with a 3-D printer to print personalized statues.

BlablabLAB setup an interactive art installation on the streets of Barcelona, which allows users to stand in a structure surrounded by three Kinect sensors.

The sensors capture a 360-degree video of the person, then sends details to a low-resolution 3-D printer, which spits out a small thermoplastic figurine.

You can watch a video on the [BlablabLAB project over at Vimeo][2].

Its a pretty cool low cost, high tech approach to personalized printing.

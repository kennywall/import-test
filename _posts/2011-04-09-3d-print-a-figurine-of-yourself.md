    A group of innovators called BlablabLAB have integrated a Kinect with a 3-D printer to print personalized statues.BlablabLAB setup an interactive art installation on the streets of Barcelona,
    which allows users to stand in a structure surrounded by three Kinect sensors.The sensors capture a 360-degree video of the person, then sends details to a low-resolution 3-D printer, which spits
    out a small thermoplastic figurine.You can watch a video on the BlablabLAB project over at Vimeo.Its a pretty cool low cost, high tech approach to personalized printing.

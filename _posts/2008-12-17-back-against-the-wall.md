{% include JB/setup %}<p>Sit with your back against the brick wall
At least I wont get shot in the back
Sizing everyone up
Establishing the threat level
Drink in my hand
Light up my smoke
Threat level is moderate
Drink is sour, what I need
TWo more logs on the fire
Where is the guy in plaid from
I dont know.Bricks are warm
Doors are in view
Now I can think clearly.</p>

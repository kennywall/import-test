{% include JB/setup %}<p>Course Description: Data mining is used to discover patterns and relationships in data.Emphasis is on large complex data sets such as those in very large databases or through web mining.Topics: decision trees, neural networks, association rules, clustering, case based methods, and data visualization.The following chapters from the textbook will be covered in this order:

	Chapter 1 - Introduction
	Chapter 2 - Data
	Chapter 3 - Exploring Data
	Chapter 6 - Association Analysis: Basic Concepts and Algorithms
	Chapter 4 - Classification: Basic Concepts, Decision Trees, and Model Evaluation
	Chapter 5 - Classification: Alternative Techniques (naive bayes models, support vector machines)
	Chapter 8 - Cluster Analysis: Basic Concepts and Algorithms
	Chapter 10 - Anomaly Detection

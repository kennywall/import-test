{% include JB/setup %}I am impressed with Rackspace donating the code for their compute and object storage platform and creating the OpenStack. There has been a lot of discussion around the need for a cloud storage API standard, and whether or not Amazon should be the base for an cloud computing standard.
I think it is a very smart move for Rackspace to step up in this way. It will do a lot for the industry and cloud adoption, and put them ahead in the game. I see a couple of immediate benefits:

	Availability of proven open source software to get compute or storage infrastructure up and running
	Promote standard of operation between cloud service providers
	Opportunities for city, state, and federal government to deploy cloud infrastructure

I like how they focused on the cloud computing essentials:

	Computing Power
	Object Storage

Check out this list of projects they are working on:

	OpenStack  Compute (nova)
	openstack-android
	OpenStack Development Infrastructure
	openstack-ipad
	openstack-iphone
	openstack-web-control-panel
	OpenStack  Object Storage (swift)

Open Source cloud compute power and cloud object storage. Mobile platform support for IPad, IPhone, and Android. Management tools and development tools. Very nice.
And you can't have a much cooler launch partner than NASA.

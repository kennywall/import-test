{% include JB/setup %}<p>I was watching the recent Reid Hoffman interview on Charlie Rose and they discussed the topic of which handheld he uses.
He uses a Blackberry an IPhone as well as regular cell phone. Then Charlie Rose also said he uses the exact same configuration.
They said they use:

	IPhone for web surfing
	Blackberry for Calendar, Contacts and Office functionality.
	Cell Phone for calls.

Its a funny balance of gadgets....and that they both are like that....wonder how many more professionals are like that.
I have 2 Blackberries, just personal and business.</p>

     I was watching the recent Reid Hoffman interview on Charlie Rose and they discussed the topic of which handheld he uses. He uses a Blackberry an IPhone as well as regular cell phone. Then Charlie Rose also said he uses the exact same configuration. They said they use:
</p>
<ul class="mainlist">
     <li>IPhone for web surfing
     </li>
     <li>Blackberry for Calendar, Contacts and Office functionality.
     </li>
     <li>Cell Phone for calls.
     </li>
</ul>
<p>
     Its a funny balance of gadgets....and that they both are like that....wonder how many more professionals are like that. I have 2 Blackberries, just personal and business.

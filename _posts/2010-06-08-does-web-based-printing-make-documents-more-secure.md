    I've been paying attention to the <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/">Google Cloud Print</a> project at Google Code. With Google Cloud Print you can:
    <ul class="mainlist">
      <li>Register any printer to be accessible via the Internet for printing by authorized users
      </li>
      <li>Allow authorized users to print to this device with multiple devices (desktop, laptop, mobile phone)
      </li>
    </ul>Seem like as a business owner I would be able to temporarily open up my printer for a client, vendor or customer and allow printing. Then the person printing could send a document straight
    to the printer without actually sharing any digital files.<a href="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/"><img src="http://code.google.com/apis/cloudprint/images/overview.gif" alt="" align=
    "right" /></a> <strong>Would this make documents more secure?</strong> I could send only printed copies to someone I wanted to view my document. Since it was transmitted over the web, the
    document transmission could be logged showing that a single print copy license was delivered to this business at this address. Seems like it could add a new layer to secure document sharing.

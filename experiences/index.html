<h1>Experiences</h1>

<p>It can be difficult to capture what I do, the experiences I have as the <a href="http://apievangelist.com/" tqrget="_blank">API Evangelist</a>. I do not have a job, there is no start or stop to my work day, I work all the time, evangelizing the concept of an API across small businesses, the enterprise, government and amongst the average citizen.</p>
<p>The concept of a resume for me doesn't really exist anymore. The demonstration of my ability and experience is an aggregate of my blog(s), <a href="https://twitter.com/kinlane">Tweets</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kinlane">Github repositories</a>, research projects, talks, images and videos. While this all provides a summary of who I am, and what I'm doing, it was lacking detail on the experiences I have.</p>
<p>My experiences page reflects the meaningful milestones in my past, that have affected my life, career, and ultimately my message as the API Evangelist. As I begin documenting my world in this way, I'm sure I'll find new experiences from the past, and the process will also evolve understanding of how I experience things in the future.</p>
<p>Here are the major experiences in my career spanning the last 20 years.</p>

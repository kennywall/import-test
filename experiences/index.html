<h1>Experiences</h1>

<p>It can be difficult to capture what I do, the experiences I have as the API Evangelist. I do not have a job, there is no start or stop to my world, I work all the time, evangelizing the concept of an API across small businesses, the enterprise, government and amongst average citizens.</p>
<p>The concept of a resume for me doesn't really exist. The demonstration of my ability and experience is an aggregate of my blog(s), Tweets, Github repositories, research projects, talks, images and videos. While this all provides a summary of who I am, and what I'm doing, it was lacking detail on the experiences I have.</p>
<p>My experiences page reflects the meaningful milestones in my world, that affect my life, career, and ultimately my message as the API Evangelist. As I begin documenting my world in this way, I'm sure I'll find new experiences from the past, and the process will also evolve understanding of how I experience things in the future.</p>
<p>Here are the major experiences in my career spanning over the last 20 years.</p>
